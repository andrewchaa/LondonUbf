2010 Acts 9 

HOLY SPIRIT CAME ON ALL WHO HEARD THE MESSAGE

Acts 10:1-11:18 
Key verse: 10:44
While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.

Jesus told the Apostles in Acts 1:8, 'But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." And indeed, they preached the word in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and also at the gentile lands outside Israel. We have seen at the end of last Chapter how Peter preached the gospel at Joppa and Lydda on the outskirts of Judea.  Now in Chapter 10, Peter preaches to a gentile called Cornelius. Though the gospel had already been preached in Samaria,  Cornelius  is regarded as the first real gentile convert. Through today's passage, may God help us to learn God's love for all people and share his heart, overcoming our narrow mind. 

Look at verse 1. 'At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.' Caesarea is a port city about 104 km north west from Jerusalem. This city was built by Herod the Great. In those days it was under Roman occupation and a regiment was stationed there. Cornelius was one of six centurions in the Italian Regiment which had about 600 soldiers. Altogether 4 centurions appear in the New Testament. They are all known to be noble people. First centurion appears in Mark 8. He valued and loved his servant like his own son and Jesus said he had not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. The second centurion appears in Luke 23:47. After seeing Jesus' crucifixion, he praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man." The third centurion is Cornelius in today's passage. Later, we also see another centurion who wanted to spare Paul's life (Acts 27:43).

Who was Cornelius in today's passage? Look at verse 2.  'He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.' He and his family were devout people. He prayed all the time and also helped out the needy. He also seemed to know the Old Testament very well. Yet, he was not a part of the circumcised Jewish community meaning, he was a gentile and wasn't converted to Judaism (10:45). While he was praying at the ninth hour (around 3 in the afternoon), he distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea." (4b-6). Cornelius was a gentile, but his sincere prayer was heard by God. God intervened directly and led him to Peter, who was staying in the Simon the tanner's house. Here we can see God's sovereign leading in all parts: there was a reason for Peter staying in Simon's house in Joppa. Given that tanning was regarded as unclean, Simon's house must have been located far from the village. Cornelius immediately called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa. At the same time what did God do in Joppa? 
God showed another vision to Simon Peter who was staying in Joppa. Look at verse 9. 'About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.' The distance between Caesarea and Joppa is about 50 km. When the people sent by Cornelius were near by Joppa, Peter was praying on the roof. Peter went up on the roof at the 6th hour which is around 12 noon. What happened to him then? Look at verse 10. 'He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.' He was very hungry and perhaps had smelled cooking downstairs. At that moment, what did he see? Look at verses 11-12. 'He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air.' The four-sides of the sheet means four directions ' north/west/east/south ' in other words, it means the whole world. In that large sheet, there were all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air and animals such as pigs, dogs, cats, mice, owls, snakes, cockroaches, bats, etc. When Peter saw all these, he must have completely lost his appetite. Yet, what did he hear then?  

Look at verse 13. 'Then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter. Kill and eat." The voice said to him to kill and eat those animals. Perhaps, if he had not seen what was inside the sheet, he would have been pleased to eat. Yet, he must have become speechless after seeing what was inside. It was impossible for Peter to even think about it. What did he answer so? Look at verse 14. 'Surely not, Lord!" Peter replied. "I have never eaten anything impure or unclean." Peter's strong rejection was not based on his personal belief but it was what all Jews firmly believed based on Old Testament scripture. They were taught that they should not eat certain unclean animals as written in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14:3-20. They had to obey those commands and needed to live as Holy people, separated from others for God. Peter also did not even touch those animals. He had kept those regulations from a young age and was determined to do so continually. His answer in verse 14 was absolutely not. 

Then, what does it mean to kill and eat those animals? This means that in the era of the New Testament, (ritual) regulations do not need to be literally kept. Hebrews 9:10 says, 'They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings--external regulations applying until the time of the new order.' That is, regulations on food became nullified by the fulfilment of the gospel through Jesus' death and resurrection. Yet, Peter did not know this. So, God tells him again. Look at verse 15. 'The voice spoke to him a second time, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean." God 'has made' clean: it means it has been done already. Now that Jesus has come, there is no distinction between clean and unclean animals. (Mark 7:19, 1 Tim 4:4). 
Colossians 2:14-16 says, 'Having cancelled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross. Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.'
Look at verse 15 again. Here, it says, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean." Here, the subject is Peter. This emphasises that Peter himself should not call anything impure which God has called pure. 

Then, why did God show Peter such a vision? It was to help him overcome his strong Judaism. Peter accepted Jesus' world mission command, yet in reality, he still couldn't think about preaching the gospel to the gentiles. This was because of his strong Judaism, thinking that the gentiles were unclean and therefore should not even be approached. He regarded them like the animals in the sheet. To break such strong prejudice, God himself intervened and showed him a vision to overcome Judaism and accept world mission. Verse 16 tells us, this whole vision of the sheet coming down and the voice commanding him to kill and eat and Peter strongly protesting 'happened 3 times. This shows how strong Peter's Judaism was and at the same time, how clear God's direction was. In fact, the number 3 is very significant. In the past, Peter denied Jesus 3 times. After he had risen, Jesus told him to feed his sheep 3 times. What Peter saw seemed to be unbelievable. Jews normally thought heaven is holy, yet in this vision all sorts of unclean animals were coming up and down from heaven. Indeed, by the coming of Jesus, we no longer have any distinction between clean and unclean things and between the chosen people and gentiles. Through this event, God prepared Peter's heart to serve world mission. 

To obey Jesus' world mission command and serve a student mission, we also need to overcome our own Judaism ' our own thinking, style and ideas. For instance, in the case of 'Koreanism,' age and hierarchy becomes an issue. We can also lack sensitivity in serving people. For Koreans to serve world campus mission, we must overcome our Korean-ism. 

Each of us has our own Judaism. When we overcome this for the sake of Jesus and his gospel, I believe that God could use us in his redemptive history more effectively as his priests. One more thing we can learn from this event is that we are all unworthy to receive salvation just like unclean animals. Pastor Harry Ironside (Moody Memorial Church) was particular struck by this verse. He said that he is just like one of the four-footed animals ' nothing else, but enters the kingdom of God by the grace of God alone.  

Peter saw the vision three times, but could not understand. That much, what God was intending was unthinkable and revolutionary in Jewish culture. God continually helped him by showing him clear evidence. Look at verse 17. 'While Peter was wondering the meaning of the vision, people who were sent by Cornelius arrived and asked for Peter.' While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Simon, three men are looking for you.' The Holy Spirit gave Peter such a clear and specific command and when Peter went down, surprisingly he found the men sent by Cornelius. Peter could now slowly understand what his vision meant. 

Look at verse 23. Peter asked them to come and stay. It is difficult for a Jew to invite a gentile and eat together. Yet, as soon as Peter knew God's will, he immediately obeyed it and served them. The next day, he went with them to Cornelius. There, he saw Cornelius and his friends and relatives.

 Look at verse 25. 'As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence' Cornelius showed his highest honour to Peter. This shows his humility. In particular, he did so, because he valued Peter as a servant of God. Yet, how did Peter react to this? Look at verse 26. 'But Peter made him get up. "Stand up," he said, "I am only a man myself." Peter did not lift himself up. He talked together with Cornelius. If one is regarded so highly by other men, it is to snatch God's glory. This will bring misery to both parties. 

Look at verses 28-29. He said to them: "You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean. So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?" Before explaining the reason of his visit, Peter first told them the traditional Jewish custom. He had a good attitude to lay out the problem first in order to resolve it in God's way. In fact, in the law only marriage to the gentiles was prohibited. This was to help Israelites not to be influenced by the prevalent idol-worship culture in Canaan (Deut7:3). It was only Jewish traditions and not the law which prohibited their fellowship with gentiles. Yet, those traditions were abolished by Jesus. Now in him there is no distinction between gentiles and Jews. Peter now understands and accepts this fact. 

Peter said when he was sent by the Spirit, he came without raising any objection. At this, Cornelius also explained the reason why he sent people for Peter (30-33a). He now says, 'Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us." He is truly a man of faith and humility. His attitude pleased God and helped him to receive the grace of the Holy Spirit. Peter realised through Cornelius that God chooses people not according to appearance or one's ethnicity but he does so by looking at their faith in God.

Verses 36-43 give the essence of the gospel. That is, Peter testifies to Jesus' death and resurrection. He preached that we can be saved by the name of Jesus alone. This was the same message at the Pentecost in Jerusalem. 

Look at verse 44. 'While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.' This was also like at Pentecost (11:15) ' Pentecost at Caesarea. The significance of this event is that this was the first time that gentiles received the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit powerfully worked among them when they accepted Jesus' message of the cross and forgiveness. The Holy Spirit gave them inner conviction and the grace of being born again. It was all initiated and fulfilled by God. He himself showed Cornelius and Peter a vision. He also gave his spirit to the gentiles. He himself indeed initiated the world/gentile mission which was hard for Jews because of their strong Judaism. He confirmed all by giving them the Holy Spirit. 

Humanly, Peter and Cornelius were very different. One was the Roman officer and the other was a Jew in colonial Israel. It is by God's sovereignty that they could meet each other. Also, this was possible because of Cornelius' devout life and Peter's obedience towards the work of the Spirit. 
 
Peter wisely did not go by himself. Instead, he took six brothers with him. (11:12). They were later able to witness to what had happened to Cornelius and the gentile believers. They were also amazed when gentile believers were speaking in tongues and praising the Lord just as they had at Pentecost (11:15). God loves all people and he wants the gospel of Jesus to be preached to all people and to all nations. 

Look at verse 47 and 48. "Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have." So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days."  Peter could not resist God's intervention, who poured his Holy Spirit among the gentiles. He ordered someone who accompanied him to baptise Cornelius and his family. He himself like Paul dedicated himself to preach the word (1Corin 1:15).

Chapter 11 verses 1-18 were about some criticism Peter received by some Jews who did not know how all these things happened. At this, Peter told everything that happened to him humbly.  He concludes in verse 17. 'So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could oppose God?" Here, the word 'gift' was emphasised. God gives his Spirit to all people when we believe in Jesus as a gift. When Jerusalem believers heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, "So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life. This broke the wall between Jews and gentiles and widely opened the door of gentile mission. 

From this passage I was struck by how difficult it was for Peter to overcome his prejudice and visit the house of Cornelius. It needed God three times to get his message across. This gives me a sense of how difficult it is for me also to see myself and change and broaden my heart. This morning, having breakfast with Joshua, I asked what is my Judaism, what are the cultural things that I am blind to, that I need to overcome to build better relationships with those around me, particularly my Korean co-workers? Joshua was too polite to tell me, he is already too much of an Englishman! But I suppose the nature of blindness is that it takes time to identify, to find where I need to change and grow. What I am struck by though, was the simplicity of the solution for Peter, which was to visit Cornelius house and spend time with him. It was simply in this way that he could share God's word and build a relationship with a gentile and allow the Holy Spirit to work. Last night Paul popped round to my house and we had a cup of tea and a chat. There was no reason for it but for the sake of fellowship. It made me realise this kind of thing happens too little, partly because everyone is busy, but still I need to take time and thought, just to talk and pray together with co-workers. 

I also learn that the way the Holy Spirit works is far wider than we tend to expect. Our ministry can become quite programmatic in terms of how we raise disciples of Jesus, but the Holy Spirit works differently. I learn I need to remain flexible and be sensitive to how the Holy Spirit is working. 

In conclusion, Cornelius is the first fruit of gentile mission. The fact the Holy Spirit came upon all those who were hearing Peter's message was as crucial as Saul's conversion in laying the foundation of world mission. In doing so, God helped Peter to overcome his strong Judaism. We also need to overcome our strong Judaism ' our own style and biased thinking ' to serve world campus mission.

May God also help us to overcome our own Judaism and grow to have a broad heart to serve all people in the world and obey Jesus' world mission command.
