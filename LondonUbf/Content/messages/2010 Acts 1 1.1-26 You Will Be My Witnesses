2010 Acts 1

YOU WILL BE MY WITNESSES

Acts 1:1-26
Key Verse: 1:8
'But you will receive power when he Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.'

We begin our study of Acts. This is a crucial 'hinge book' that explains the growth of the early church and ties together many of the books of the New Testament. The equivalent in the Old Testament is Joshua that explains the growth of Israel.  Without the book of Acts we would move from Jesus death and resurrection and a small band of Jewish disciples in Jerusalem to a group of gentile believers in Rome being written to by a former Jewish Pharisee that was not even mentioned in the gospels! The book of Acts explains this amazing spread of the gospel. The author of the book is Luke. The gospel of Luke traces Jesus' messianic work on earth. In this book, Luke writes from Jesus' ascension, to the church's birth by the Holy Spirit on Pentecost to its growth across the world. It is a continuation of Jesus' work as he builds his church. The key verse of the entire book is 1:8. 'But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.' This was the very last command of Jesus. It also provides a sort of 'Index of Contents' for Acts because it records the gospel spreading in Jerusalem in chapters 1-7, through all Judea and Samaria in chapters 8:1-11.18 and the remainder of the book tracing the progress of the gospel to the whole world as symbolised by Rome (11:19-28:31). I pray that we may accept the very last command of Jesus 'you will be my witnesses' deep in our hearts though this message.
  
Look at verse 1-2. 'In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.' Theophilus from the Greek means 'a person whom God loves' or 'a friend of God'. We know from Luke's gospel that he was the recipient of the letter being referred to as 'most excellent Theophilus' (Lk 1:3). There are many guesses about who was Theophilus. Some people say that it does not refer to an individual but to all the saints whom God loves. Yet the title 'most excellent' suggests the book was devoted to a particular individual and indicates Theophilus was a real historical figure. He must have been in a high position such as a governor or higher. Some speculate it was Felix who was the governor of Judea (23:26), or his successor Festus (25:1). Such people could have funded Luke and been a patron for his investigative work. We don't know. But what is clear is that he must have been an intellectual who had known about Christianity to some extent and had an interest in it. 

Luke had already recorded some details of Jesus ascension but here he provides further detail. Look at verse 3. 'After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.' We see here the central fact of the Christian faith ' Jesus is alive! Jesus suffered much on earth. He was treated as a criminal and was brutally flogged, crucified and died. But the grave could not hold him and he rose again from the dead in 3 days. What did he do after his resurrection? He appeared to his disciples and gave them many convincing proofs that he was alive. According to the Gospels, Jesus appeared to them on at least ten occasions and proved that he had risen again with his body (Mt 28:1-10; Mk 16:9-18; Lk 24:13-50; Jn 20:11-23, 26-29; 21:1-23; 1Co 15:5-8). Luke recorded some of these events in detail - such as when he appeared to the two disciples who were on the way to Emmaus and helped them to believe his resurrection based on the Scripture. He appeared to the disciples and showed them his hands and feet where the nail marks were. He ate fish before the disciples. Some have said that the disciples were hallucinating but it is very hard to get a hallucination to eat! Jesus helped them to believe his resurrection with many kinds of convincing proofs.  The central fact of the Christian faith is that Jesus is alive. The risen Jesus stayed with his disciples for forty days in order to plant resurrection faith. 

What else? The second thing was that he spoke about the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is a kingdom where God is enthroned and rules as king. The kingdom of God was the theme of not only of Jesus' teaching but the whole bible. It had been prophesied through the prophets of the Old Testament and started with Jesus' coming into the world. It will be completed by Jesus' second coming. Jesus spoke more about the kingdom of God after his resurrection and helped them to have faith in its fulfilment. We can learn that the core of what we should believe and teach is Jesus resurrection and the kingdom of God. All earthly kingdoms and everything that belongs to them will perish. There is nothing eternal in them. Yet God's kingdom is eternal. There is neither sin nor death in the kingdom of God. It is the kingdom of true happiness and life. The fulfilment of this kingdom is the answer to the problems of our lives and our true hope. Therefore Jesus taught his disciples to pray, 'Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven' (Mt 6:10). 

But how does the kingdom come? Look at verses 4-5. 'On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit." Jesus was with is disciples and he was about to be taken up to heaven. Jesus gave them clear instructions. What were they?

First, 'Do not leave Jerusalem.' Actually the disciples would have been eager to leave Jerusalem because it was a city of their failure and fear. Why did Jesus say not to leave Jerusalem? Because it has an important meaning in God's redemptive work. Historically, Jerusalem was where King Solomon had built the temple on Mount Moriah (2Ch 3:1). Mount Moriah was the earlier site of where Abraham tried to offer Isaac as a burnt offering (Ge 22:2). It was prophesied that the word of God would come out of Jerusalem (Isa 2:3; Micah 4:2) and of course Jesus was crucified there. Jerusalem was the centre of truth and the foundation in which the gospel was accomplished. Even today we can see this. In Jerusalem last week I could not help notice the religious focus of the place in the old city with its Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Armenian quarters. The world senses the importance of Jerusalem. Just east of the city walls there is a huge area of Jewish, Muslim and Christian graves. Do you know why? Because each wanted to be buried there in order to be the first to see God's return. People believe that the resurrection and judgment will begin here when God comes at the end of history. The truth of the gospel had to arise from Jerusalem. Therefore Jesus commanded them not to leave.

Second, 'wait for the gift my father promised.' Here the gift refers to the counsellor, the Holy Spirit (Jn 14:16,17,26; 15:26; 16:7-14). Jesus was clear ' they had to wait. This is because if they tried to do this without the Holy Spirit they will only muck it up. Without the Holy Spirit there is no church. Without the Holy Spirit there is no work of God so they had to wait for the Spirit. Just as Jesus was anointed by the Holy Spirit, they had to be anointed by the power of the Holy Spirit before they began the work of expanding the church (Lk 4:18). The Holy Spirit's work would be to teach them the secret of the gospel and to enable them to testify with power and authority. In a few days at Pentecost this happened. The Spirit of God would be poured out on all people in the last days (Joel 2:28). Now the baptism of the Holy Spirit would be poured upon the disciples and on all believers who repented their sins and confessed their faith in Jesus Christ.       

It is helpful to be clear about the baptism of the spirit. Luke 3:16 described it as the baptism of fire. Fire symbolises the burning up of sins. John's baptism of water was an external ceremony of washing whereas the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the work of God which transforms the inner heart of people and enables them to receive salvation. It happens when we repent our sins and believe in Jesus Christ as Lord. This baptism is not possible without repentance. Being born again is only possible with the baptism of the Holy Spirit. All born again Christians have received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. He dwells in the hearts of the believers (1Co 3:16). The language and early accounts of the Spirit can sound quite dramatic and some emphasise the need for external experiences of ecstasy, speaking in tongues and the like. Such special experiences are present today, but they were mostly given to the early church as the evidence of the coming of the Holy Spirit. These are not the main focus of his work. Therefore it wouldn't be right and could even be dangerous to seek such experiences like signs and miracles rather than the Holy Spirit himself. We have received the Holy Spirit when we acknowledged Jesus as the Lord. It is because without the help of the Holy Spirit, we utterly corrupt human beings cannot confess Christ as Lord (Mt 16:16-17; 1Co 12:3; 1Jn 4:15). Receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a one-off occasion but to receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit, we should continue to seek to grow spiritually and pray for it. 

The Holy Spirit is vital to God's work. Without the Spirit there is no work of God. Yet while Jesus was teaching them about the kingdom of God and the baptism of the Holy Spirit, what were the disciples thinking about? Look at verse 6: 'So when they met together, they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?" They misunderstood Jesus. They had dreamed about the independence and restoration of Israel while they followed Jesus. They dreamed about a powerful kingdom of Israel above all nations like that of King David. They thought Jesus as the Messiah would be king and they would be the rulers of the kingdom. Their ambition had been crushed with Jesus' crucifixion but restored with Jesus' resurrection. They revealed what they really wanted - the restoration of Israel. So they asked Jesus, 'Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?' Here, the word 'asked' [lego'] is a primary verb suggesting that they had been asking repeatedly. They kept asking Jesus, 'Are you at this time going to do it? Is it now? When? Come on!'  

In many ways this is understandable as Jesus had been talking of the Kingdom but their question indicates they were only expecting a national kingdom. Likewise we can at times only think of our church or our country but Jesus builds his church across the world in all its forms. Jesus understood their desperate heart but corrected their notions of the Kingdom's nature, extent and arrival. What did he say to them? Look at verse 7: 'It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.' He didn't say that they should not be thinking about such an insignificant matter. Rather he said that it was God's work and they should entrust it to God. They should not try to know the times and dates God had set but trust him. What then should they do? Look at verse 8: 'But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.' Soon the Holy Spirit that God had promised would come. Then they would receive power. They would become Jesus' witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. This was a description of future events that would come true. It was also Jesus' plan and hope for his disciples. To the disciples, it was their life direction that should be obeyed. It was the very last command of Jesus. We can think about it in two parts.  

First, 'But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you'. Here 'But' is emphasized at the beginning of the sentence. It means that the disciples should absolutely trust God about the matter of Israel's restoration and instead concentrate on this one thing Jesus was talking about now. The Holy Spirit would come in the place of Jesus (Jn 16:7). When the Holy Spirit comes on them and he baptizes them, they would receive heavenly power. What kind of power is it? It would be all power that was necessary to live as Jesus' witnesses. What they needed was not money, worldly authority or political power. All they needed was the Holy Spirit. Jesus said that they would receive heavenly power when they receive the Holy Spirit. We also have many desperate problems like the restoration of Israel that we want restored. 'Lord are you at this time going to restore my home, my work, my finances, my study, my health?' But God knows our situations. May we entrust all such matters to him and first receive the power of the Holy Spirit to live as witnesses of Jesus. You will receive power.  

Second, 'you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.' In the Old Testament, God had called Israel as a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. Yet they failed to hold this mission. Now Jesus wanted to fulfil the mission that has been given to the Israelites in the beginning through his disciples. The area of mission that was given to the disciples was Jerusalem, all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth. Jesus' gospel work started from Galilee and went through to Jerusalem. The disciples' work will start from Jerusalem and reach to the ends of the earth. What should they do? 'You will be my witnesses.' The mission is to witness to Jesus. Who is a witness? A witness simply speaks about what he has seen and heard. He is not a theologian or a philosopher. In legal terms a witness in court should merely testify to what he knows so that people who hear may believe his words. A witness cannot give hearsay i.e. they must talk only of what they have personally seen and experienced. They do not say 'I think' but 'I know'. Witness or martus in Greek is where we derive the word 'martyr'. Jesus said that they would become 'my witness'. It was because they would be witnesses 'to him', 'for him', and 'all that is concerned about him' ' its all about Jesus. They should live as witnesses, who were sent by him and only for him. They would not fear death to witness all about him with the attitude of a martyr. The disciples, and furthermore all believers, should witness to Jesus' death on the cross and resurrection. It is the direction and purpose of a believer's life. It is life saving work.

Look at verse 9: 'After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.' Soon after he gave this command, he was taken into heaven. He gave them no time to debate and discuss the mission. It was because this command is absolute. This command of Jesus demands our absolute obedience. There is no room for compromise according to our situations. Here 'before their very eyes' means that they had been looking at Jesus constantly while he was being taken up. They looked intensely at Jesus ascending. While they were murmuring, 'Err'the restoration of Israel, the Kingdom',' Jesus had already gone up and hid him from their sight. The cloud hiding Jesus from their sight meant that they should not hold on to their dreams any longer. Nor could they hold Jesus but should immediately obey his very last command. There was no reason to waste time. Men and women of faith do not spend time looking at the sky waiting for visions and signs. Rather they accept that Jesus has already accomplished the gospel and take up the command to preach, and devote themselves to making the most of every opportunity. The devil does not get much chance to work in a diligent person. He makes works for idle hands.

Yet Jesus disciples seem stuck. They continued to look intensely at the sky. At that time, two men dressed in white said to them, 'Men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.' The angels called them 'men of Galilee'. They reminded them that they were from a despised area, former fishermen and tax collector who couldn't do anything within their own strength. The angels planted the hope of Jesus' second coming. They testified that Jesus would come back in the same way they have seen him go into heaven.

They must have wanted to go back to their hometown Galilee yet they obeyed Jesus' words and came back to Jerusalem. What did they do there? Look at verses 13-14. 'When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.' The eleven disciples gathered together in the upper room with the women, Jesus' physical mother and brothers and prayed earnestly. If people have complaints and divisions in their hearts, that community cannot pray together. When we try to pray many obstacles can rush in. Suddenly we get a call from a friend who hasn't been in touch for long or suddenly we feel the need to call someone. Or write an email, tidy up, or fix something in the house first. But we should overcome all things that block us from praying and put in effort to wrestle in pray. Jesus' disciples must have had their own reasons not to pray but they put prayer as their first priority and prayed together. They made an environment for the Holy Spirit to work by praying together. The number was about 120. They built a prayerful community while waiting for the coming of the Holy Spirit. They built the church by praying in one heart and one spirit. Even today, the church is built up and revived when believers pray together in one heart and one spirit. 

Yet as they prayed like this, there was a problem that troubled their hearts'it was the matter of Judas Iscariot. He was one of the Twelve but sold Jesus and hung himself. Their hearts became downcast whenever they thought of him and couldn't understand why this had happened. They were perhaps fearful that they could go the same way. If Judas failed why not me? In those days, Peter stood up among them and spoke. Judas was in charge of the treasury in Jesus' ministry. He was trusted by Jesus. Yet he didn't bear Jesus' blessing. He was tempted by his love for money and sold Jesus. But it happened as had been prophesied in Scripture (Ps 69:25; 109:8). His miserable death was the accomplishment of Psalm 69:25, 'May their place be deserted; let there be no-one to dwell in their tents.' Peter solved the problem of Judas' betrayal from Scripture. It was not some tragedy or unexpected accident but had already had prophesied and was under God's sovereignty.    

Moreover, he quoted Ps 109:8 'May his days be few; may another take his place of leadership,' and suggested to fill his place with someone else. We know from the Book of Revelation that the twelve disciples represent the twelve tribes and the whole world. Therefore the empty place had to be made up. He must be someone who was with the Eleven the whole time until Jesus was taken up. He must be a witness of Jesus' resurrection. The message of the early apostles was simple'Jesus has risen. They had no theology or special ceremony. The good news of Jesus' death on the cross and resurrection was all. He must be a witness with them of this simple gospel. It seems that there were only two men who fulfilled this criteria -- Joseph called Barsabbas also known as Justus and Matthias. They prayed and cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias. It seemed that Barsabbas was an eminent candidate because he appeared first and had both Hebraic and Roman names. But God, who knows the heart, chose Matthias. 

In conclusion, the disciples had a strong desire for the restoration of Israel. But Jesus gave them only one command - to live as his witnesses, from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth. A believer is a witness. A true believer is the one who witnesses to the fact of Jesus. In our own strength this is impossible. But the power of the Holy Spirit enables us to do this. May we live as Jesus' witness, from our home, the university we live in and to the ends of the earth according to God's leading, unto the day of Jesus' seconding coming. May we serve this life saving work only by receiving the power of the Holy Spirit!
