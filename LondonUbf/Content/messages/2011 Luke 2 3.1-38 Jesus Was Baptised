2011 Luke 2

JESUS WAS BAPTISED

Luke 3:1-38
Key verse 3:21-22
�When all the people were being baptised, Jesus was baptised too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.�

In today�s passage, Jesus begins his public ministry. But before he did so God prepared the way. Before any important visit there is preparation. Imagine the preparation for a visit by the Queen. People make sure that the flower beds are in mint condition. They paint the room where the official meeting is going to take place. The staff are told to look as presentable as possible. Or schools facing a government inspection. They run about for weeks in advance getting their paper work in order and want to create the right impression. Or even for us with a Christmas service in a few weeks � whatever the important event there is preparation. Finally the promised Messiah was going to be revealed. It would be inconceivable if this would not be announced. And so John was sent to prepare the people for the arrival of Jesus. His mission was to prepare God�s people to receive God�s promised salvation. How were the people to prepare? Be ready for celebration? Paint the rooms and look nice? As the bumper sticker says, �Jesus is coming. Look busy�. No. It was through repentance. May God bless his word to us and open heaven to us.

I. Baptism of repentance (1-17)

Look at verses 1-2: �In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar� when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene�during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert.� Luke is telling us the political and religious background to Jesus ministry. It�s either 26 or 28AD depending on how you calculate the start of Tiberius� reign. We know that it was a time of peace and political stability, so much so that Tiberius Caesar was confident enough to have left Rome for early retirement to the isle of Capri. The Roman Empire was stable. There was also a common language, Greek, so extraordinary communication was possible over this huge empire. Later the early church would use this and the Roman roads to rapidly spread the gospel around the world. Pontius Pilate, King Herod, Herod�s brother Philip, and Lysanias. Four rather brutal officials that dominated the secular politics: These are the people who were going to be involved not only in John�s death, but in the death of Jesus Christ. Luke also tells us something about the leadership of the church at that time with two high priests � Annas and Caiphas. Annas had been the high priest but was removed by Rome yet he still ran the religious affairs of the day. So much so that 5 of his sons, as well as one grandson, all followed him as high priests, one after another, and then his son-in-law followed them and he is the Caiaphas who is mentioned here. These two men, father-in-law and son-in-law, had the religious life of Judea in their pockets. They ran the Old Testament church like a business � just as if it belonged to them. It�s a miserable list of men. It was dark time in which there was a spiritual vacuum. But the good news for us is that means no matter how dark our times, our circumstances, or our personal lives, God can overrule it all. It means we should never judge God�s power and ability by our present circumstances. In the very darkest night, He can prepare to do His brightest work. How does that work begin?

Look at verse 2b: �the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert.� Luke explains how God�s redemptive work was prepared and started under such a background. The word of God came to John. It seems the word of God should have come to the high priests or to the Pharisees or teachers of the law who studied the word of God in a beautiful office or temple library. But God began a new work. He prepared John son of Zechariah. The angel Gabriel had appeared to his father Zechariah and made him mute for 9 months. He enabled John�s mother Elizabeth to conceive a child in her old age. As a result John was raised strictly in obedience to the angel�s commands. He was kept from fermented drink. He lived simply and purely. From a young age, he went out into the desert region around the Jordan River. He learned to survive on locusts and wild honey. Why the desert? The desert is a symbol of judgment on the land that God�s prophet was not at home amongst God�s people. The desert to Old Testament believers was a testing time purging them as they prepared for the Promised Land. So John was warning the nation not to get comfortable. They were not to enjoy the prosperity of Roman peace. Rather they were pilgrims and strangers in this world and they needed to get ready by purifying themselves as God is pure. 

How did John prepare the people? Look at verse 3: �He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.� John preached a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. The work of God started with a message of repentance. Where there is the work of repentance, there is the work of God. What is the repentance he is talking about? It is to mourn for the sins committed. But it is more than Godly sorrow. Repentance is to confess our sin but it is more than merely acknowledging our sin. Charles Finney in a book �True and False Repentance� thought false repentance was possible. He said true repentance is not only `sorrow' for sin, but more importantly a `turning' from sin. The word itself denotes a `change' of direction. Finney points out that a man is not saved by `intending' to do right, but by turning to God and abandoning his sin. This is the preparation that John was calling people to for the coming of Jesus. 

What made John�s ministry so powerful? It was the fulfilment of God�s word of promise to the prophet Isaiah. Look at verses 4-6: �As is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: �A voice of one calling in the desert, �Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all mankind will see God's salvation.��
Why was John�s ministry so powerful? Because it was God�s work. As the prophet Isaiah said, John was a voice of one calling in the desert. According to Isaiah�s prophecy, he became a herald for Jesus and called out: �Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.� In order for Jesus to come into our hearts, we have to prepare the way for the Lord. For him we have to make straight paths. All gospel writers refer to this passage from Isaiah but only Luke quotes verse 5-6. Why? Because Luke is making sure we note that this is for all men � verse 6 �all mankind will see God�s salvation�.  Sin creates in all men valleys of despair, sorrow, inferiority, and fatalism. Such a heart must be filled in. Sin causes us all to become full of pride and self righteousness that are like high mountains. Mountain like hearts should be lowered and humbled. A sinful life is a crooked life that lurches from one crisis to another. This kind of twisted heart must be straightened by repentance. Then our King Jesus can come into our hearts and as verse 6 says we �will see God�s salvation�. 

The problem of man is not the condition in which he lives but the state of his heart. No matter how high a position he has in society; no matter how wealthy or famous if his heart is like a valley or a mountain or crooked or hard to God there is no life. Therefore, John courageously preached the message of repentance in the desert: �Repent! The kingdom of God is near.� �Repent! And all mankind will see God�s salvation.�

It sounds tough but John�s message of repentance was shockingly refreshing and powerful. Look at verses 7-9: �John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, �You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, �We have Abraham as our father.� For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. The axe is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.�� The people were not congratulated or comforted for coming to hear John. He was not very seeker sensitive! Rather they were rebuked that their decision to come to him was merely outward and superficial. He challenged them that if they wanted to be right with God as his beloved children, they had to repent in such a way as to bear fruit. 

John�s message of practical repentance challenged the basic pride of the Jewish people. The Pharisees� thought they were the ones who had the law of God and the discipline to practice it. Ordinary people perhaps knew better but they thought that basically they were fine with God because of their national identity. John, however, smashed such Jewish pride. He told them, �Do not begin to say to yourselves, �We have Abraham as our father,� for I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.� The Jews did not need to be proud of their spiritual heritage as Jews. They needed to be thankful and humble for God�s amazing grace that had called them out of all nations to be his treasured possession. They needed to repent so that God�s purpose in calling them might be realized fully. 

This message is just as much for us. Like the people of John�s time, we are easily made complacent regarding our need to repent. Instead of humbling ourselves and acknowledging our failure to live up to God�s purpose for us as his people, we engage in formal repentance that easily makes us proud and self-righteous. Personally, I have said before things like: �I repent that I don�t spend enough time in Bible study.� But I know in my heart that while that may be true, I spend more time in bible study than most people. So my repentance only reinforces my belief that I am indispensible child of Abraham. John�s rebuke challenges that basic assumption. The fact is, we are stones or rocks on which God had mercy and found hope in. We cannot afford superficial repentance. None of us can. Sooner than we think, judgment will come. We must humbly listen to the message of repentance and bear the fruit God is looking for. 

How did people respond to John�s challenging message of repentance? Look at verse 10: �What should we do then? The crowd asked.� With a broken and humble heart, they asked, �what should we do? How should we produce fruit in keeping with repentance?� What was John�s answer to the crowd? Look at verse 11: �John answered, �The man with two tunics should share with him who has none, and the one who has food should do the same.�� John did not answer theologically or doxologically. John�s message was not trite or sentimental. Rather he gave very practical direction. In short John challenged their selfishness. People want to live a better and richer life. But John�s preaching addressed a fundamental spiritual problem of God�s chosen people. They were called by God so that God might bless them and make them a blessing. But in sin they only craved to receive more and more blessings from God. They sought their own welfare and own happiness. In short they became self-centred and selfish. We can learn here that real repentance is to stop being selfish and to obey God�s will for us to serve him and his people. 1 John 3:16-18 says, �This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers. If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him? Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.� May God help us to humbly repent for our selfish lives and love others!

The tax collectors and soldiers also came to John to be baptized. Look at verses 12-14. �Tax collectors also came to be baptized. �Teacher,� they asked, "what should we do?" "Don't collect any more than you are required to," he told them. Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely�be content with your pay."� The tax collectors and soldiers were not religious people. The tax collectors were Jews who had betrayed their own people to serve the Roman Empire. The soldiers were Gentiles. But they came to John to be rebuked and to repent before God. And John�s message to them was exactly the same. Stop being selfish. Stop thinking only about yourself. Soldiers thought they could not live with their pay but John told them to be content with their pay. It meant that they must not grumble about low pay but give thanks to God. Today, many people are not content with their pay. They are not content with their life. They are not content with what God has given them. Many want to live a better life and as a result we become more and more selfish. Repentance is to be thankful and turn from greed. As Apostle Paul said, �I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances� (Php 4:11). Real repentance bears real fruit. May God help us to bear real fruit through confessing and repenting of our sins � turning from our self centred heart to the living God, Jesus!
 
John�s ministry was so powerful and life-changing that people began to wonder if John might not possibly be the Christ. He performed no miraculous signs. But his message was truly life-giving. How does John answer the people? Look at verses 16-18: �John answered them all, "I baptize you with water. But one more powerful than I will come, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." And with many other words John exhorted the people and preached the good news to them.� John could have been proud of his humble lifestyle and clear calling from God. But he knew that he was sent to baptize only with water. The real change he looked forward to was the One whom God would send to baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire. The ministry of Jesus was going to be far greater than restoring the kingdom to Israel. He would come bringing the Holy Spirit to restore God�s Lordship in the hearts of every man, woman and child. Those who submitted to the work of Jesus would be gathered up in the harvest for eternal life. But those who to the end remained self-seeking and who rejected the truth would be discarded and burned like the chaff. 

This was a powerful and effective message. But the ministry of preaching repentance was very costly to John. Look at verse 20: �Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison�. We see John was arrested for rebuking Herod the tetrarch. Later he would be beheaded. This tells us that just because John was faithful didn�t mean that everybody responded positively. You may be faithful to the ministry of the word; you may be pure and hard working but this does not always result in people embracing Christ by faith. Sometimes it ends up with people hating the message and hating the messenger. It can end in prison and death. Yet despite the end John�s ministry was such a great blessing to the whole world. He preached repentance and forgiveness from God. He prepared the way for Jesus. The message of repentance is not gloomy or dark. It is the message of good news. When we repent of our selfishness and idolatry, we can begin to live a life that pleases God and fulfils the purpose for which God made each of us. In short repentance prepares the way for Jesus, the greatest blessing.

II. Jesus was baptised (21-38)

Why is Jesus the greatest blessing? Because he opens heaven to us. Look at verses 21-22: �When all the people were being baptised, Jesus was baptised too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.� While people came to be baptised, Jesus humbly came and was baptised by John. 

There is a lot we could say here. But I want to think of two points. First as he prayed heaven was opened. Until this point heaven was closed. Sin closed the door of heaven and man was expelled from God�s presence. Mark�s gospel says of this moment that heaven was �torn open�. It�s the same word to refer to the tearing of the temple curtain. There was an impenetrable barrier between God and man but at Jesus� prayer heaven opened. Thanks to Jesus� prayer, the door of heaven was open and holy treasure and blessing come on earth.  What are the blessings that come when heaven opens? God�s Holy Spirit and God�s word. The Holy Spirit came like a dove on Jesus. A dove symbolizes purity. It also symbolizes love, gentleness and peace. The Holy Spirit is not like a fierce eagle or flamboyant peacock. God is powerful but he works in purity, love, gentleness and peace. With heaven open people could hear God. What did they hear? �You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.� Jesus is the son of God but he humbled himself and submitted himself and his body to God for the salvation of man. In the genealogy of Jesus, Luke makes the same point � Jesus is the son of God. 

In conclusion we learn here the real purpose of repentance. It is not mere regret or world sorrow for our sins. It is not mere confession. Rather it is a clear and practical decision to turn from our selfishness and submit to God�s will for our lives. It is the decision to submit to the conviction and leading of the Holy Spirit. Jesus� decision to submit to God�s will was clear. Nevertheless, he struggled to the end to carry out his decision. His flesh longed for another way to serve God. We must struggle in repentance until we can surrender our own will and accept his way as the only way for our lives. May God bless us to repent and submit to God�s will. May heaven open and Jesus come into our hearts!
