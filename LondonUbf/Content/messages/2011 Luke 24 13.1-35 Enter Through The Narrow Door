ENTER THROUGH THE NARROW DOOR
Luke 13:1-35
Key verse 13:24
Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.

In last week�s passage Jesus told the Jews that they were good at predicting the weather but did not know how to interpret the present time spiritually. Today Jesus addresses two recent tragic events, and challenges the people to repent and bear the fruit of repentance. He also teaches us to make every effort to enter through the narrow door. I pray that God through his Holy Spirit may give us repentant hearts and a new desire to come to Jesus through the narrow door.

I.	Repent or perish
  
Verses 1-5 talks about two tragic events. First, there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. We don�t know exactly what event this refers to but scholars think that some Galileans were in trouble with the Romans. It was most likely at the time of the Passover, when people were offering hundreds of sacrifices every day and the temple would have resembled something like a slaughter house. Perhaps the Galileans were caught at the time in the temple and cut down by the Romans. Second, people died when the tower in Siloam fell on them. How did Jews view these two events? Jesus asked two questions, �Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?� �Do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?� People tended to think that such people experienced tragedy directly because of their sins. Yet Jesus clearly told them �I tell you no!� that was not the case. Tragedy can happen to anyone. Jesus warns us not to interpret tragedies according to our own thoughts and ideas. Recently there have been tragedies like Haiti or the Tsunami in Japan. At that time how did we think? What was going through our minds and thought worlds as believers? However were we thinking, in verses 3 and 5 Jesus makes clear how should we view those tragedies Look at verses 3 and 5. �But unless you repent, you too will all perish.� Where as personal sin sometimes does have direct consequences, tragedies can happen to anyone. Anything can happen to anyone regardless of their sins. We shouldn�t be so quick to think that this is the result of their sins. At the same time, we shouldn�t boast when we are okay. Jesus says �unless you repent.� We need to realise that if we do not repent we will experience God�s judgement and perish. Therefore, repentance is the only way not to perish but to be saved. 

Repentance on the whole is not an easy subject; people don�t like hearing a message of repentance. By its nature, when done sincerely and honestly before God it is uncomfortable, painful, difficult. It means no longer hiding, or making excuses or treating things lightly. It means coming to God as we are. And for that reason repentance is a great grace that Jesus bought for us on the cross. He died so that we could come back to God, no matter what we have done, or how serious our sin, confident in Jesus� forgiving love, confident that our sins are paid for, and that we can begin again. True repentance brings true freedom, peace and forgiveness.  There are three parts to repentance, confession, contrition, and change. Confession involves being absolutely honest about who we are before God. It is difficult, particular when we feel so ashamed and just want to hide or excuse or ignore. Contrition comes when God opens our heart to see the seriousness of what we have done, when we realise how our sin damages ourselves and others, and we take responsibility. Change is when we are sorry enough to completely turn from our sin, we make a decision that practically my life will be different, and it will bear the fruit of repentance.  

In verses 6 and 7 Jesus tells a parable about the importance of bearing the fruit of repentance. We should remember Jesus is on the way to the cross, on the way to Jerusalem. He was going to pay the price for people sins so that they could repent and come to God and be forgiven. The trouble was they weren�t repenting; they were talking about the weather, talking about Galileans sins and in their complacency resisting Jesus. Look at verses 6-7. �Then he told this parable: A man had a fig-tree, planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, 'For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig-tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?�   A man had a fig tree in his vineyard. He looked after it whole heartedly yet the tree didn�t produce any fruit. The owner became disappointed and decided to cut it down. At this, the gardener asked his master to leave it alone for one more year, and he would dig round it and fertilise it. If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.

In this parable, we are like fig trees planted in God�s vineyard. God wants us to bear much fruit. He wants us to be transformed by the power of gospel and to bear the fruit of the Spirit � love, humility, devotion � as well as the fruit of saving souls. Why then is it that a fig tree couldn�t produce fruit even if it is in the best vineyard? Why don�t people produce fruit even if they are in God�s vineyard? Again it is a question we can ask ourselves. Yesterday, I was talking about how difficult it is to raise disciples, I was talking about the problem of our time, student�s pride, lack of spiritual interest, the bad reputation of Christians that make them distrust. Yet I found all my attention was on the outside conditions, rather than the inner condition of my heart and faith and the quality of my relationship to Jesus. Simply, it is not me who bears fruit, it is Jesus who bears fruit in me. Lack of repentance blocks the fruit of the Holy Spirit and God working and believers from growing. It prevents us from receiving the nutrition that enables us to bear fruit. God is patient and waiting for sinners to repent. Notice this parable doesn�t end with god cutting the tree down but with Jesus saying wait one more year. It is Jesus� heart to fertilise us, he wants us to be fruitful, and see us grow. But let�s take the warning in this parable seriously, lets repent sincerely and come to Jesus and bear much fruit. 

II.	A Crippled Woman Healed on the Sabbath

Look at verses 10 and 11. �On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.� There was a woman who was crippled for 18 years. How fatalistic she must have been! Satan made her crippled and made her suffer endlessly. She was at the synagogue yet she wasn�t able to receive any comfort from the word of God. Jesus saw her and called her. When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, �Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.� The Pharisees just didn�t care about her. They ignored her agony. Yet, Jesus had compassion on her and called her with affection. Then, he blessed her by setting her free from her infirmity � from the grip of Satan. For 18 years, she was unable to stand straight. Yet, by the power of Christ, she immediately was able to stand up. She praised of God and glorified God. This was a truly amazing work of God. However, there were people who instead of being joyful and thankful for what God had done, were furious towards Jesus for not keeping the Sabbath. The Lord answered him, You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water? Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?  When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing. 

III.	The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast

Look at verse 18-19. �Then Jesus asked, �What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to? It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air perched in its branches.� How small is the mustard seed? It is known as the smallest seed. Yet, what happens when it is planted? It doesn�t remain as it is. Instead, it grows and grows because of the life in it. How much did it grow? It became a tree and the birds of the air perched in its branches. The kingdom of God is like this. It starts like a small mustard seed and people can�t even notice it. Yet just like a mustard, it grows because of the life it contains. Job 8:7 says �Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be.� The future of God�s kingdom can�t be compared to its beginning � it becomes so big that all wondering souls can perch. 

What else did Jesus say? Again he asked, �What shall I compare the kingdom of God to? It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.� Yeast is very different from flour. Even a small amount of yeast can work all through the dough. This doesn�t happen immediately. Fermentation takes some time. Likewise, the grace of God starting in our heart needs to work through our heart and change it. The beginning of God�s kingdom starting in our heart may be invisible at first like yeast � yet, as the yeast works through the dough, it will gradually grow and change through our life, our family, church, universities  - our country and this generation. Flour can�t change itself without yeast. If we plant the gospel of Jesus into the heart of one soul, it will transform his heart and change his whole life and through him, the gospel of Christ will spread out to the world.

IV.	Enter the narrow door 

Look at verses 22-23. �Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem. Someone asked him, Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?� Do you remember that at the beginning of Chapter 12 crowds of many thousands were coming to Jesus? Yet it seems that Jesus preached in all the towns but surprisingly, only few people were actually following him, committing to him, believing in him. This must have puzzled this man so he asked the question. How did Jesus answer? Look at verse 24. �Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.� Have you noticed people have been asking Jesus several questions about the many? Peter in the previous chapter had asked �Lord are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?� They then ask about the Galileans and the tower of Siloam. People are interested in the many, but Jesus� answer is always addressed personally. He says �unless you repent.� Here he says �make every effort to enter through the narrow door.� He is talking about our personal struggle before God.

This is a very shocking passage, partly because Jesus� answer is that many will not be able to enter, but also because salvation isn�t presented as easy or effortless or cheap. Jesus says make every effort to enter the narrow door. Another translation is �strive to enter.� The original Greek word is agonisma, we get the word agonise from it. It means to spiritually battle, an intense struggle. A battle to be rid of everything that gets between my self and Jesus. To get rid of the idols, the worldly dreams and desires, the laziness and complacency and self will that resists accepting and obeying Jesus as Lord. We are saved by faith in Jesus, when we repent and accept him as Christ, but this is a daily striving, a zeal and enthusiasm to be with him. It means self denial, daily losing our lives for Christ. It means continuing to work out our faith with fear and trembling. This is not cheap grace.

There are two kinds of doors � one is a wide door and the other is a narrow door. The wide door looks like an inviting way to enter; it is easy and convenient. Many can pass through at the same time without a problem. Since there are many who are entering this door, they won�t feel lonely or insecure. On the other hand, the narrow door looks hard to enter. Not only entering itself, it looks like the narrowness continues along the path. Not many are there so we can easily feel lonely. Because of these reasons, we always feel like choosing a broad door instead of a narrow door. But why does Jesus emphasise entering through the narrow door?  Matthew 7:13-14 says �Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.� Jesus is narrow, he is exclusive. He says �I am the way.� There are not many ways only his way. His way is the only way to receive life, life now and life for eternity.� This is a tough message to give to a pluralistic liberal society. It is a message of judgement.

Look at verse 25. �Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir, open the door for us.' But he will answer, 'I don't know you or where you come from.� Who are the people who stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir, open the door for us.'? They are people who missed the opportunity to enter the narrow door because of their spiritual complacency and laziness. How did the master re-act at this time?  �But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!� Our Lord Jesus calls those who squander their lives of faith following the pleasures of this world as evildoers and asks them to leave him. Once the door is closed, it will never open again. This is a clear warning about God�s judgement and hell. People might say how mean, how unjust is God, how can a loving God send so many to hell? Yet we must understand what salvation is.  Salvation means salvation from God�s wrath as judge and being delivered into Jesus� arms. We stand condemned already. Jesus went to the cross, went through unbearable suffering and punishment, in order to open a narrow door, that all those who are condemned might have a chance of escape and freedom. The door is open but not for long he is now saying, quick run through it. This is God�s mercy.

Noah in the Old Testament made every effort to build an ark after receiving warning from God of his judgement plan. People laughed at him and thought that he was crazy.  Therefore, to the very end date, they focused on eating, drinking, getting married � which are all earthly and physical things. However, God�s judgement plan was carried out just as he said. All lives were thrown into the water. Now is the time of God�s grace when the door is open. Yet, soon the time will come when it isn�t open again. On that day, there will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out. However, those who made an every effort to enter God�s kingdom will participate in the heavenly banquet. 

Jerusalem, Oh Jerusalem

Look at verse 31-33. �At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, �Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.� He replied, �Go tell that fox, 'I will drive out demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.' In any case, I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day� for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!� Jesus was not intimated by what the Pharisees said. Instead, he wanted to go his own way firmly without being discouraged. He was faithful and believed that the man of God lives in God�s hands. Jesus, even at this point of being danger of losing his own life, was more concerned about the sins of Jerusalem.
Look at verses 34-35. �O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing! Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'�

Throughout this Chapter Jesus has been warning, challenging, urging the Jews to repent and enter the narrow door. He knows what is going to happen, he knows the reality of God�s wrath and judgment, he is willing to suffer and die to open the narrow door back into God�s grace, to gather them like a hen with her chicks. 

From this passage I am struck by the need for spiritual struggle, to keep repenting, to make every effort to enter the narrow door. There is in me a tendency to want to blame God, to ask why aren�t you working, why aren�t you bringing about revival, why aren�t you working faster to raise disciples? But in this passage I see Jesus has already done everything. He has pleaded with God for patience on our behalf, he wants to fertilize and nourish me and bear fruit through me. He has gone to the cross and sacrificed, suffered and endured more than anyone, that we might be saved. He longs to embrace us and for us to come to him. The problem is not him, it�s me. I have no right to be angry or impatient. Instead the revival has to begin with me. I need to come to him and repent, to have a sense of urgency and zeal. If God is slow to bear fruit in me, I need to pray and find out why. It is not because of outside conditions, it is a matter of my heart and faith and the willingness to repent, sacrifice and suffer for those who are lost. 

To believe and follow Jesus means to enter the narrow door. Salvation and life � victory and glory are all via the narrow door. May God help us to overcome the laziness and pleasure seeking trend of this generation and deny ourselves daily, taking up our crosses and live as disciples of Jesus so that we may enter the door of salvation, life, victory and glory.
