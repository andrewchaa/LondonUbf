THE PARABLE OF THE TENANTS

Luke 20:1-47
Key verse 20:13 �Then the owner of the vineyard said, �What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.��

Last week we saw how Jesus entered Jerusalem on a colt as the saviour king. What did he do when he entered? He started acting with the authority of the Messiah. He drove out the merchants and cleared the temple. The religious leaders rather than repenting wanted to kill Jesus. Throughout this chapter we see them come up against Jesus� authority, questioning it, testing him, and trying to undermine him. Jesus tried to help them find their sin and repent by teaching them the parable of the tenants. I pray we may accept the authority of Jesus and respect him as God�s only son. I pray we may also faithfully steward the vineyard God gives us in this generation. 

I. Jesus questioned about his authority (1-8) 
Look at verses 1, 2. �One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief prests and teachers of the law, together with the elders came up to him. �Tell us by what authority you are doing these things, they said. Who gave you this authority?� These things refer to the previous day when Jesus cleared the temple. It also refers to Jesus preaching the gospel. In 19:48 Luke describes people hanging onto his words. The people loved Jesus� teaching, it was the very words of God, his words had life and truth and the authority of God. The Pharisees couldn�t kill Jesus because of all the people, so they instead wanted to discredit him by questioning his authority. 

The chief priests and the teachers of the law thought that the authority to do God�s work comes from gaining a qualification from a seminary ascribed by the Sanhedrin and being appointed and sent by the Sanhedrin. They thought they themselves were those who have the authority and also who can give the authority to others. But Jesus was a carpenter from Galilee; he didn�t have any qualification. Then how could he teach in the temple and with what authority could he clear the temple and rebuke the chief priests and the teachers of the law? 

Actually if they had sincerely looked at Jesus life they would have to acknowledge Jesus� spiritual authority. Jesus had raised the dead, the paralysed walked, lepers were cleansed, demon possessed were freed, the eyes of the blind were opened and he had fed the five thousand with five loaves and two fish. They must have known Jesus� amazing authority. They must have felt ashamed when Jesus cleared the temple and said, �It is written, �My house will be a house of prayer�, but you have made it into a den of robbers.� They should have accepted Jesus� authority and repented their sins before him. They should have repented of their materialism and hypocrisy. They didn�t teach the word of God to the people but clung on the rituals and robes and certificates and so instead of repenting, they began to question Jesus. �Tell us by what authority you are doing these things, they said. Who gave you this authority?�

Jesus could have answered them by justifying his spiritual life fruit which testified to his authority. Yet instead he asked them a question Look at verses 3,4. �I will also ask you a question. Tell me, John's baptism� was it from heaven, or from men?� In this question Jesus makes a distinction between two kinds of authority, �from heaven� and �from men.� And he points to John the Baptist. He preached the baptism of repentance by the river Jordan. It awakened the people of Israel from godlessness and roused a spiritual revival. Many people came to John confessing their sins and were baptised by him. John the Baptist had unquestionable authority but this authority didn�t come from the Sanhedrin or from men. He didn�t have any qualification or pass any exam to say he could preach or teach God�s word. He lived in the desert devoting himself to praying and listening to the word of God until he appeared before the people. John�s ministry was clearly with the authority from heaven. And what did John preach? He preached that Jesus was the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! That Jesus was more powerful than him, that he was unworthy to unite his shoe laces. John�s ministry fully endorsed the authority of Jesus as the Christ. 

Spiritual authority comes from God. The religious leaders should have known this and received this authority from their deep relationship with God. Yet they became comfortable with their titles and their certificates and cloths of office and lived a ritualistic and hypocritical religious life. They ended up having no spiritual authority. 

What did they answer Jesus? Look at verses 5,6. �They discussed it among themselves. �If we say, 'From heaven', he will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?' But if we say, 'From men', all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.� They realised Jesus had made them choose between death by stoning or becoming Christians, nice move! They had to acknowledge that John�s baptism came from heaven. But if they did, they would have had to repent of their sin and accept Jesus as the Christ. If they only they did, they would have been saved. They could have been changed into sincere servants of God. But they didn�t want to repent because of their pride and their appearance before people. They couldn�t say that John�s baptism was from men because they feared that people would stone them. So they answered, �We don�t know where it was from.� So Jesus answered, �Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.� 

II. The parable of the tenants (9-19)

Jesus wanted to help these spiritual leaders find their sin and accept Jesus� authority as the Christ. So he told them a parable that would help them see themselves from God�s point of view. Look at verse 9. �He went on to tell the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.� A man made a vineyard out of a vast wilderness. He burnt all the weeds and useless trees, ploughed the land, got rid of all the stones, fertilised and watered it. It became a fertile and promising land. Then he planted the best quality vines there. In Matthew�s gospel, he built a wall, a winepress and a watchtower (Mt 21:33). He hired some tenants and made them work in this fantastic vineyard. They didn�t have a job before then. They must�ve been looking for a job. How miserable they would have been when having nowhere to work with their youth, talent, passion and potential! But the master of the vineyard chose them and gave them this beautiful fully equipped vineyard to work in. He gave them the privilege to work the land and make a profit. He encouraged them to work hard and produce the best quality grapes. He gave them the best conditions that they needed only to give him some of the fruit as the rent. Then he went away for a long time. 

Look at verse 10. �At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty handed.� Now the time had come for grapes. The master sent his servants to collect his share of the fruit. He expected that the tenants would give him the rent with real thanksgiving and appreciation. But what did they do? They beat him hard and sent him away empty-handed. How could they do that? They repaid the master�s grace with evil. They completely forgot the grace they had received from the master. They treated the servant as if he was a robber trying to steel their possessions.

So what happened, what could explain this change of heart from gratitude to bitter violence against the master�s servant? They can�t have been like this from the beginning. They must have been so thankful for the master. One thing is over the passage of time, they simply forgot the grace. Originally they must have thought giving some of the fruit was nothing. But after they worked hard under the boiling heat of summer and how they had struggled to produce fruit, they came to have a sense of self-righteousness about their fruit. They began to think the master hadn�t done anything for the fruit and now he was demanding the fruit of their labour. They began to think that because they had done the work they owned the vineyard. The servant suddenly turning up reminded them that they were only the tenants. They didn�t like that. Even giving the master some of the fruit was, too much, it was an acknowledgement that he was the true owner, and that really grated on them, so they did not want to give him anything. When they lost their gratitude for the grace they received, it bred greed in their hearts and greed made their hearts evil. 

The servant came back to the master empty handed with his head and leg bandaged because of the beating. How would the master have felt? How easy it would have been to respond with anger and vengeance? But the master amazingly sent another servant. He might have thought that it could have been a misunderstanding because of the servant�s immaturity. So he sent a more graceful and humble servant and made sure that he communicated well his heart. He thought that even if the farmers had evil thoughts and made a mistake, this time they would repent their wrongdoing. But contrary to the master�s expectation, the farmers beat him, treated him shamefully and sent him away empty-handed. The master sent a third one whom they wounded and threw out. Now the farmers were going too far. 

How discouraged the master would have felt? His pride was hurt. He could have become furious and punished them severely this time. But what did he do? Look at verse 13. �Then the owner of the vineyard said, �What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.�� The master said, �What shall I do?� Their action must have hurt him so much but he knew what he would do to turn their hearts back. He decided to send his beloved son. It�s worth pausing here for a moment and remembering what Jesus is doing. He is talking to the religious leaders about their rejection of God and God�s solution, which was to send his only son. This is grace upon grace. Not only were they given the vineyard, when they rebelled and treated him shamefully, still he was willing to reach out to them. And at what cost! Any father knows how precious their child is. When one is sinned against one wants to respond with vengeance, but God responds by being ready to sacrifice what is most precious to him. How can we understand this love.    

Jesus was trying to help the Pharisees understand God�s heart. He wanted them to respect him, as God�s Son as their last chance for reconciliation with the father. From this we can tell that what God really wants from the tenants was respect for his son not the fruit. He wanted the religious leaders to respect Jesus, accept his authority as king, his sovereign ownership of their lives. If he wanted the fruit, he could have sent his army to collect the harvest and give the vineyard away to others. But he wanted a relationship of love, trust, thanks and respect with the tenants. The tenants didn�t value their relationship to the master, they couldn�t care if it was cut off, they just wanted to keep the fruit for themselves. They wanted their own control, their own sovereignty, their own ownership of their lives and the vineyard. They regarded it more important to satisfy their greed than to maintain their relationship with their master. When their hearts were filled with greed, their greed blinded them. Greed robbed them of discernment, thankfulness and joy. When they lost their right relationship to their master they had no peace or happiness. They became foolish. 

But the master didn�t give up on the tenants to the end. He wanted to restore his relationship with them. They betrayed him but he loved them. They turned away from his expectation and trust but he persevered with them in love and tried to turn their hearts back. He sent his beloved son to them. He was his only son. He knew he risked sacrificing his only son to have his relationship to the evil tenants restored. 

But how did the farmers treat the son? Look at verses 14, 15a. �But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. 'This is the heir,' they said. 'Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.� They saw the son and talked to one another that they should kill him and take the vineyard for themselves. They thought if they were rid of the son they could take the inheritance for themselves. So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. James 1:15 says, �Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.� Their sin which began with ingratitude, grew to rejection and ultimately gave birth to death. They killed the son and they themselves would be destroyed. 

How did the master punish them? Verses 15b, 16a. �What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.� The farmers had misunderstood the master�s character because of his patience and love. They thought he was a weak man. Yet it was not the case. The master gave them many chances to repent but when they didn�t and finally killed his son, he burned with anger. He destroyed the evil men completely and gave the vineyard to others. 

Jesus was speaking this parable of judgement as a warning primarily to the religious leaders, who were rejecting Jesus. But it teaches us all the same spiritual principle, either we respect Jesus, and accept his ownership and authority in our lives or we reject him. People reject Jesus simply out of greed, greed for sovereignty over their own lives, greed to rule as they please. The farmers thought if they cut off their relationship with the master and pretended the farm and their lives were their own, for their own enjoyment and control, independence and will, they would be happy. Then they wouldn�t need to work hard every year to bear fruit and give it to the master. They thought, then, they could enjoy the freedom, romance and quality of life, they could pursue their own ideas, appetites, and lusts. But is true? They might have felt freedom when they rebelled and cut off the relationship to the master and acted as if they were the owners of the vineyard. But their lives would become one of self-indulgence and laziness but it couldn�t last. 

When we acknowledge God as our master and owner we can work hard as a steward with a sense of mission to bear beautiful fruit. When we deny ourselves and take up our crosses in a loving and trusting relationship with God, and devote ourselves fully to the glory of God, we enjoy true joy, happiness, freedom and peace. Therefore God, as the owner of our lives, wants us to bear fruit for him and he wants to bless us. Giving means that we acknowledge God as the owner of all we have and serve him as the master. We should repent of our greed that says, �My life is mine and I will live as I please.� We should turn away from wanting to enjoy all the fruit ourselves without giving any to God. We should give thanks to God and live for the name and the glory of the Lord. All is entrusted to us and we should live as the stewards. 

God by his grace has forgiven our sins and called us in this ministry for the privilege to work and bear fruit in the vineyard of universities. But if we become unthankful and live for ourselves in laziness, greed and self-indulgence, God will take away our privilege and give it to someone else. We should hear God�s warning. I pray that we may give God our fruit of thanksgiving, devotion and love and bear the blessings God has given us. 

Look at verse 16b. When the people heard this, they shouted, �May this never be!� But Jesus said to them that it would be done as it was written in the psalms. Look at verse 17. �Then what is the meaning of that which is written: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone'?� Jesus knew that he would become the stone the builders rejected. He knew that he would be captured by the religious leaders, thrown out of the vineyard and killed on the cross. But Jesus remembered also that it was written, �the stone the builders rejected has become the capstone�. He would be killed by the unrepentant religious leaders but he would become the capstone for God�s redemptive work by defeating death and rising again from the dead. He believed that God�s work would not fall or fail because of the sin of the sinful men but there is the victory of resurrection over the death on the cross by the sovereignty of God. Jesus could see the victory through resurrection beyond his approaching death on the cross. 

Therefore Jesus was not swayed by anything but persevered with stubborn sinners helping them to repent. �Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.� Those who do not believe Jesus to the end would fall on the stone of judgement and be crushed. According to this word, Israel was crushed and scattered all over the world. They lost their country and wandered in sorrow for a long time. 

Also in this chapter we see both the Pharisees and the Sadducees attempt to undermine Jesus over the issue of taxation and the resurrection. Jesus defeated them simply with the word of God. The Pharisees and Sadducees thought they were wise but because they did not respect Jesus as God�s son, their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 

From this passage I learn first the amazing love of the father who sent his only son, I see freshly his love that so wanted to forgive, embrace and restore even the most hateful and rebellious tenant. That forgiveness is mine in Jesus. But I also I need to accept Jesus� authority and respect him as God�s only son. Of course I would not stand before you and say anything else. But what does it mean to accept his authority and respect Jesus? What does it mean to have him as the capstone of my life? The religious leaders hung onto their own authority and out of pride and did not struggle spiritually and did not repent and so they couldn�t bear fruit. They wanted to enjoy their vineyard for themselves. I can see the temptation to enjoy my life, my family, my job, my position in this ministry and live as I want, according to my choosing. But this is a severe warning from Jesus. He wants me to learn authority comes from Christ when I fully accept and obey his words with my life struggle. I pray I may grow in the authority of Jesus as an obedient and humble servant rather than enjoy the cheap illusion that I am owner of my own life.
