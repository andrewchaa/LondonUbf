Key verse: 20:24
'However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me'the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.'

    Today we see Paul's farewell message in Miletus to the Ephesian elders. It's the only sermon in Acts spoken to Christians ' all the others are evangelistic sermons to non believers. It's a message to believers of the foundational principles of the life of faith. In short it is a message to us. In this we come to see Paul's life as a shepherd and his view of life. May God help us to hear Paul's heart and attitude to his life of faith.

    Look at verse 1: 'When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said good-by and set out for Macedonia.' So where are we? Its Paul's third journey following the riot in the theatre of Ephesus Paul decided to set out for Macedonia. Paul wanted to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia as he mentioned earlier in Ch 19:21. It was to receive contributions for the church in Jerusalem. As we can see from verse 2, he travelled throughout that area and arrived in Greece. This was a journey that perhaps spanned a year as he went from Ephesus to Corinth visiting Philippi, Thessalonica and Berea, the churches he had planted earlier in his second journey. He stayed 3 months in Greece (Achaia) probably because it was winter. It's around AD 56-57 and from here Paul wrote his letter to the Romans and received the warm hospitality of Gaius (Ro 16:23). That's where we are.

    Look at verse 3: 'where he stayed three months. Because the Jews made a plot against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia.' After staying 3 months he knew that his mission in Corinth was completed and he wanted to leave for Jerusalem. It seems that he was going to take a ship direct to Israel. No doubt there were many Jewish pilgrims that wanted to keep the Passover in Jerusalem and many would take this journey. But Paul found out that the Jews who persecuted him were planning to assassinate him. It would be easy to push him overboard on the ship while sailing. So he changed his plans and went the slower land route back through Macedonia. He was accompanied by Sopater from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. In total 7 people travelled with him. These men were the representatives of the Gentile churches who had made substantial offerings for the believers in Jerusalem over the previous 2 years. They had not only the mission to deliver the offerings but also the mission to preach the gospel with Paul. He must have been happy with these fellow co-workers and it was a great way to train and build up these men. They went on head to Troas and waited for Paul to arrive by land. It seems Paul and Luke quietly observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread in Philippi meditating on Jesus who was sacrificed as the Passover lamb. He waited until this was over and joined the others at Troas, where they stayed seven days. 

    Look at verse 7: 'On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight.' On the first day of the week when Paul stayed in Troas ' this is the first mention in Acts of the Lord's Day i.e. Sunday. We have one of the first accounts of what a Sunday service was like. Notice that Luke twice mentions the breaking of bread (7,11). In the early church these two were closely related. The first was the Lord's Supper i.e. communion, and the other was the Love Feast ' which was a common meal where people would bring food and eat together. It marked the family spirit of the church. Paul wanted to join the Lord's Day and on Monday start his journey. The place they met was an upstairs room of a house with many lamps. Because Paul had to leave the next day he spent time in bible study which continued until midnight. Wherever Paul went, he taught the Bible with incredible energy and zeal. He is now a man into his 50's but his enthusiasm and energy seem limitless. His love for them was revealed through bible teaching. Whenever he saw people he taught the word of God with this life giving spirit. Yet while Paul was teaching a young man named Eutychus fell into a deep sleep. He was a young lad aged between 8 and 14. He was no doubt tired. In those days the service would be in the evening because people worked in the day. The room was stuffy and hot and although he tried to get some cool air by sitting near the window it seems he nodded off. It's encouraging for a preacher to know that people fall asleep even listening to the best preachers! It sounds quite comic that this young man fell asleep but there is something attractive about this simple picture. The impression is of a family meeting together rather than of a stiff formal church service. Some wonder if God punished Eytychus for not listening to Paul and so he fell out the window and died. But I don't think so. Paul did not rebuke this young man. Rather he helped him. Rather than a funeral the man was revived when Paul rushed down and threw his arms around him. People saw a dramatic miracle done through Paul by the power of God. In awe and fear, they continued to talk until daylight. They experienced the risen Jesus was with them through this gracious miracle. No wonder verse 12 says they were greatly comforted!

    Moving on verses 13-16 tell us about the journey to Miletus. Look at verse 13: 'We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot.' The distance between Assos and Troas is about 20 miles. We do not know why Paul wanted to travel alone on foot rather than sale with the others. Almost certainly he wanted to have a personal time with God. Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed (Lk 5:16) and in the same way perhaps Paul prayer walked the 20 miles in the beautiful April countryside. Later Paul tells the elders 'keep watch over yourself' and here seems to be an example of that. Socrates once said 'beware the barrenness of a busy life'. Here we see Paul took time to pray, to think and be alone with Jesus. Paul met the company at Assos and went on to Mitylene by ship and sailed on to Miletus (15). He was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem for Pentecost and so sailed past Ephesus. Yet he still wanted to see the elders of the Ephesian church and so he called them so they could meet together.

Which brings us to the heart of this great chapter - Paul's farewell message in Miletus. Look at verse 18: 'When they arrived, he said to them: "You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia.' The elders in the Ephesian church knew very well how Paul had lived the whole time he was with them. Paul's life backed up his word. There was a consistency of speech and action. So he was open and courageously testified about his shepherd life. Until now we have read of Paul's journeys and pioneering but perhaps seen less of his inner life and what he actually did. Here in the only recorded sermon to believers we see the nature of his shepherd life. How was this?

First, he lived a humble and patient life. Look at verse 19: 'I served the Lord with great humility and with tears, although I was severely tested by the plots of the Jews.' People in Ephesus were locked into superstition and idol-worship. But it was a developed cosmopolitan city with a library and many intellectuals. They wanted to teach rather than to learn. So Paul had to be humble to serve them. He shed tears because of these stubborn bible students who just argued about the word of God and did not accept it. Maybe his key verse was Ps 119:136 'Streams of tears flow from my eyes, for your law is not obeyed.' Furthermore while there the Jews frequently maligned Paul and his teaching. They planted unbelief and forced him to leave. Nevertheless Paul continued to serve with great humility and with tears. The first three priorities of a servant of God are humility, humility and humility. If a servant of God loses humility he is disqualified as God's servant. If he is not humble he simply is not a servant. The humility of a servant of God is the beginning, middle and end of ministry. The way a person receives grace depends on humility and maintaining humility. This is because God gives grace to the humble (Jas 4:6). Paul did not serve the Lord with humility but with GREAT humility. 

Second, he taught everything that would be helpful to them. Look at verse 20: 'You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.' He taught anything that would be helpful to them and in any way possible - preaching, 1:1, visited from house to house. He gave anything that would be helpful to them such as his bible knowledge, his spiritual experience, wisdom, counselling ' anything that would be helpful. In this way the Ephesian elders grew as solders of faith in a city of superstition and idolatry. 

Third, the core of his teaching was the gospel. Look at verse 21. 'I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.' Paul raised them up into men of the gospel. He always focused on the gospel rather than on social justice, political development or economic problems. We never get beyond the gospel in our Christian life. We never get to something 'more advanced'. The gospel is not the A-B-C of Christianity it is the A-Z of Christianity. In short he taught them not to become like those who are full of head knowledge but rather to always repent and believe in Jesus. Repent and believe ' this is the daily walk of faith.

Fourth, he was fully committed to his mission. Look at verses 22-24: 'And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me. However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me'the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.' Paul said that he considered his life worth nothing to him so long as he completed the task the Lord Jesus has given him ' the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace. This task was absolute to Paul because he received it from the Lord Jesus Christ. If a stranger asks you to do something what is your attitude? Or what if I ask? Or your husband or wife? Our attitude to the person who asks makes a difference to how much we accept. By preaching the gospel people facing eternal destruction are saved. People give their youth, time, health and lives for things that fade. People give their lives to wealth, power, worldly fame. But all men are like grass and all their glory is like the flowers of the field (1 Pe 1:24a). These things inevitably disappoint as they fade. 

What mattered to Paul was not whether he lived or died. The only purpose of his life was to complete the task that the Lord Jesus gave him ' the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace. How could he be so faithful to the task of testifying the gospel of God's grace and maintain this to the very end of his life? It was he knew the real value of the gospel. He was convinced that the only way of salvation is to believe the gospel of Jesus Christ. He proclaimed to Roman believers, 'I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes; first for the Jew, then for the Gentiles (Ro 1:16).' He believed that trust in Jesus death and resurrection is the only way of salvation to the Jews and Gentiles i.e. everyone! Because he knew the value and power of the gospel, he had a strong identity and absolute attitude as an evangelist. Most of all Paul called the gospel 'the gospel of God's grace'. When he thought about the gospel, his heart was fresh with the grace of salvation and the grace of calling. He retained a heart that knew he was a sinner that deserved to receive punishment and to be thrown into the fires of hell but Jesus paid the price of his sin and saved him and called him as his servant. Whenever he thought about God's grace, he was compelled and revived. Men become useless when they forget God's grace. Lives become tried and powerless when we live a lukewarm Christian life. May God help us not to outgrow his grace! May we remember that our lives are not ours but belong to Jesus. 

Having reminded them of the past Paul now turns to the future and his hope for these Ephesian elders. What did he encourage them to do?

First, 'Keep watch'. Look at verse 28: 'Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.' Notice that the first thing he told the elders was to keep watch over themselves. It is the same warning that Jesus gave to his disciples in Gethsemane (Mt 26:40). It's easy for leaders to neglect themselves while looking after others. But those who do not examine their own spiritual lives but focus only on teaching and rebuke others actually cannot look after others. We should be alert to the dangers that lie ahead. Bishop Michael Bourn says that 90% of the pastor's problems have at their root that fact that they have stopped reading their bible and are not praying daily. People say 'I never thought it would happen to me'. But that is the point. The fact is we have an enemy, the devil. Paul warns to watch our spiritual life not just keep up appearances. 

Second watch one another. Paul also told them to keep watch over all the flock. It was not the church or Paul that designated them as elders. It was the Holy Spirit who gave them the task. The church that they had been entrusted with was the one that God had bought with the blood of Christ. After Paul there would come ferocious wolves who would not spare sheep. Such men arise from their number and he may even be talking to some who would later betray. In order to draw people after them, they would distort the truth. So Paul warns them to be spiritually alert and keep watch over the flock. 

Third, 'Remember.' Look at verse 31. 'So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.' Saul used to judge sin and condemn others by the law. Saul did not have tears. When he did not know Jesus, he persecuted believers and put them into prison. Yet this man became an apostle who loved, who shed many tears, when he came to know Jesus. He said that he never stopped warning each of them night and day with tears. He shed tears when he saw the pain caused by sin in the hearts of spiritually ignorant and young bible students. People tend to shed tears from self-pity or unfairness. But a bible teacher's tears for a student should be like welcome rain on the dessert of their heart. Where there are a lot of tears there is vital salvation work. Tears dry up in today's generation. We are easily consumed by our own worries and become calloused to others. It's a reflection of our corruption and heartlessness. I am reminded of Monica chasing her wayward son Augustine. When she pleaded with a Bishop to help her son he sent her away saying 'it cannot be that a son of these tears should perish'. And so it was. I believe that God accepts such tears and does his salvation work through such a heart. May God help us to shed such tears for others and share this heart.

Notice also that Paul did not think of people based on numbers. He regarded one soul as valuable and helped one by one as verse 31 says he warned 'each' of them. Paul's work was not a job but the work of love that served each individual with all his heart. The elders of Ephesus needed to remember this and likewise serve others with humility and tears rather than lord it over the flock. When they thought about Paul's exemplary life, they could become like him. 

Finally, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.' While serving the Ephesian church, Paul did not covet anyone's silver or gold or clothing (33). He deserved support from the church but he supplied his own needs in order not to bring any criticism of his gospel work. He not only supplied his own needs but also the needs of his companions (34). The reason that he lived such life was that he knew from Jesus 'It is more blessed to give than to receive'. I was talking to my father recently who is not a believer. I mentioned that nobody in our ministry gets paid. He said 'Good! When you start getting paid it's the beginning of end'. I was surprised and realised that even as a non believer he saw the value in a self supporting ministry.

Having given this message how did he end? Look at verse 32. 'Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.' Paul foresaw the coming of savage wolves, false teachers even from their own numbers. He asked the elders to keep watch over themselves and learn from his exemplary life. But he did not commit them to this wisdom. Rather he committed them to the Lord. It is the living Jesus, the head of the church sitting at the right hand of God, who accepts all the labours of spiritual leaders and builds up the church. Jesus who rose again and ascended into heaven is still living. He rules the church of his body as the Lord. Notice that Paul committed them to the 'word of his grace'. Jesus builds his church through his word. The word of God is powerful enough to protect the church from all kinds of evil and make it grow in holiness. Today the Church is attacked by many savage enemies. But Jesus, the Lord of the church will protect it. Above all, he makes the Church holy and grows this by his word. I pray that we may believe this and ferociously study and teach the Bible. 

Look at verses 36, 37. 'When he had said this, he knelt down with all of them and prayed. They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him.' They all knelt down, prayed and wept as they embraced Paul and kissed him. This is a really beautiful farewell scene. Paul loved the flock of sheep in Ephesus and they also loved him.
 
We have little time to look at chapter 21 and I leave this to personal study. In brief after Paul was torn away from them, he passed many areas and went to Caesarea and stayed at the house of Phillip the evangelist, one of the seven deacons. While Paul and his companions were there, a prophet named Agabus prophesied that Paul would be handed over into the hands of the Jews in Jerusalem.    How was Paul's attitude? 'Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.' (13) They could not dissuade him. After a arrival Paul reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. After the graceful mission report, the church elders encouraged Paul to go through the purification ritual. Paul was not legalistic but in order to gain those who were under the law he gladly accepted the suggestion (26). Through this we see that Paul was a gospel centred man who would do anything if the gospel could be preached and if he could gain people through it. 

In conclusion, the gospel is the gospel of God's grace. We cannot save ourselves. Human deeds, goodness and a religious life will not save us. Only the work of Christ through his death and resurrection can save us. This is the truth that everyone must hear and be saved by. Paul considered his life worth nothing to him if only he might complete the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace. May God help us have this kind of attitude as men and women of mission and powerfully serve campus gospel work. May God help us teach each bible student with tears and give ourselves fully to Jesus call!
