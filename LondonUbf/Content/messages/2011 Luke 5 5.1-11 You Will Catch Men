2011 Luke 5

YOU WILL CATCH MEN

Luke 5:1-11
Key Verse: 10b
Then Jesus said to Simon, �Don�t be afraid; from now on you will catch men.�
 
Luke�s Gospel has been close to my heart since I learned of an early church legend that Luke was an artist. In this passage he certainly paints a very visual backdrop of Jesus� preaching on the shore of lake Genessaret. The name Gennesaret can either refer to a harp suggesting the lake itself, but more specifically to an area on the western side of the lake. The word breaks down to �Gan� meaning garden, Sar meaning Prince and �Asher� meaning riches so we can imagine a garden of princely riches beside the lake. It was in this beautiful setting that Jesus calls the fisherman, Simon Peter. He gives him a new vision and life direction to catch men. May God help us to think about the grace of Jesus who calls Simon Peter to catch men. 

?. Let down the nets for a catch (1-7)
Look at verse 1. �One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the people crowing round him and listening to the word of God� In the previous chapter Jesus had made clear his priority and mission, to preach the kingdom of God, that was why he was sent (Lk 4:43). He taught the word of God with all his heart, not only in the synagogues of nearby towns but even here by the lake side. John Wesley made the point that whereas pulpit preaching is more comfortable, �field preaching saves souls.� Through Jesus� teaching, people were revived and received new life and healing. There were great works of God. The news on Jesus spread out and more and more people came to Jesus in the early morning. There were so many so Jesus could almost fall into water. 

Look at verses 2-3. �He saw at the water�s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.� Jesus saw some fishermen washing their nets. So we have on the one side Jesus, with people crowding around him teaching the word of God. These people want to hear God�s word. Then we have these fishermen who were preoccupied with washing their nets after a long nights fishing perhaps not so interested in Jesus� teaching, they were probably just looking forward to getting the job over with so they could get some rest. You know that feeling of working hard all night, when nothing has gone according to plan, and you just want to get home and climb into bed? Charles loves football, yet even he, after working for Sekyee all night at a bank, can�t quite make it to the pitch. 

So Jesus is preaching to these people, they are crowding round him, he might even end up in the water if he is not careful, and he sees these guys, all of whom he knows, a little down hearted, not really listening to him washing their nets, so he asks for help. Jesus got into Simon�s boat and humbly asked him to put out a little from shore so that he could get in and teach the crowd. So there Simon is, a little down hearted, but he is now listening to Jesus in the same boat, may be he is nodding off a bit, but he is there, listening. It�s worth noting here that Jesus is sitting teaching the people from the boat. He now has space from all those people crowding around him, he is able to sit and teach. Teaching is different to preaching, in that it suggests more explanation, than hammering a point home. Jesus took time to open people�s eyes to the truth of God�s word, that they might understand and accept him into their hearts. 
 
After teaching the crowd, what did Jesus say to Simon? Look at verse 4. �When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, �Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.� This was not the first time Simon met Jesus. Earlier his brother Andrew had taken Simon to Jesus. At that time, Jesus said to Simon �You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas.� This meant that even though Simon was weak, Jesus had vision for him; he would make him into a great � rock-like apostle. This was a word of hope. Simon was happy. However he did not yet have desire to follow Jesus. His hope was still in fishing. He was full of his own dreams, plans, ideas and fish. Yet, Jesus did not give him up. Jesus had healed his mother in law. Jesus had rebuked the fever and healed her. He had just now asked a favour to Simon to put out his boat a little from the shore so that he could get in and preach. In that sense, Jesus was more concerned with Simon than the whole crowd. For Simon, that morning had been one of failure and despair. A full night�s fishing had ended in vain. Yet, Jesus approached him and said, �Put into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.� 

Why did Jesus say this? Jesus challenged Simon to obey his word. Simon had met Jesus and had received his word and grace quite a few times. Yet, until now he hadn�t been challenged to obey his word. What do we think about obedience? In principle it is a good thing, no? We sing with heart trust and obey for there is no other way. Yet the reality of obedience really kicks in when we want to do something else, when what we are asked to do cuts across our will and our idea. Until then it�s just agreement. I can really understand the difficulty of obedience. I�m from a generation that grew up watching Star Wars. I rejoiced when Han Solo said to Princess Leah., �Look, you Worshipfulness, let�s get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person: me.� That�s our generation, that�s how we think, we argue rather than listen and authority is to be questioned rather than obeyed. We question why? What for? I won�t do it unless I know the reason. Who are you to tell me? Would we in Simon�s situation obey Jesus? I�m not so sure.

It�s the nature of obedience that when ever we are asked a thousand reasons flood in to our minds as to why we shouldn�t obey. For Simon obedience didn�t get much harder than this, there was every reason to object. Based on fisherman�s common sense, experience and knowledge, fish come to the surface in the evening time. Now, it was morning. Experience told Simon there would be no fish at this time. Also, Simon had just spent a night with no fish! His heart was full of negative thoughts and defeat. On top of this, Jesus was a carpenter not a fisherman. For that reason it was hard for him to obey. But why did Jesus ask him to obey? Was it just to make life difficult? No, the reason is that faith and obedience are intimately linked. Jesus wanted Simon to obey that he might experience the deep world of faith. His relationship with Jesus was only superficial. He didn�t yet know the deeper spiritual world. But, Jesus now challenged him to obey his word so that he might experience a deep faith in him and open his spiritual eyes.

But, how did Simon obey Jesus� word Look at verse 5. Simon answered, �Master, we�ve worked all night and haven�t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.� Simon confessed that he could not catch anything all night. How painful his heart must have been! He didn�t want to go fishing again. He could have said no to Jesus based on his professional. However, he did not put these things forward. He admitted his limit and failure. He also overcame his negative thinking based on what he had just experienced. He said in verse 5 � because you say so, I will let down the nets. Here we can see Simon�s greatness. He had many weaknesses to be called as Jesus� disciple. Yet, the secret of his greatness is in his attitude to Jesus� word. He honoured the word of God, overcame his own opinion and relied on and obeyed Jesus� words. This shows his humility and learning mind. 

As a result, what victory did he experience? Look at verses 6-7. �When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.� Simon overcame his painful failure and all humanistic, negative thinking. He only relied on Jesus� word and obeyed him. When he had done so, when he obeyed Jesus� word, he caught such a large number of fish that the nets began to break. He signalled his partners in the other boat to come and help. Fish filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
 
Simon experienced great victory by relying on and obeying Jesus� word. This victory could cover over all failures. His life could have ended like an empty net. Yet, by relying on and obeying Jesus� word, he experienced an amazing victory. Later on, not only this, he could live the most blessed and happy life as Jesus� apostle and disciple and a shepherd for people. Think about Abraham�s life. His life was like an empty net. He didn�t even have a child when he was called at the age of 75. But, when he obeyed God�s call as in Genesis 12 he became the father of many nations and became a source of blessing. Obedience based on Jesus� word is the source of a victorious and blessed life. 

Sometimes, we also experience deep failure and despair. We want to give up and lose power to try again. Some people become fatalistic after continued failures. Disciple making is in particular not easy. But, today�s passage teaches us that though we have failed many times, we should rely on Jesus� words and put out our nets by faith. Though we have experienced painful failures over and over again, still we should not sit down in negative, fatalistic thinking and become defeated. Instead, we should obey Jesus� word and put out the net. When we do so, Jesus will give us a victory � that is beyond our experience, reason and common sense. 

?. You will catch men (8-11)

How did Simon react when he caught so many fish? Did he say, praise God! I can now retire and put my feet up and chill out. Did he rejoice with an inflated pride, �Look guys, I�m the greatest fisherman.� We can become like that when God blesses us with success, we can become cockyb and over confident and proud. Look at verse 8. �When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus� knees and said, �Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!� He fell at Jesus� knees. Before he had called Jesus master, but now he called him Lord. By obeying Jesus� word and experiencing God�s power, he realized that Jesus is God Almighty who even controls the fish in the sea. This is in a sense an Old Testament response to God Almighty, his awesome holiness and wonder. Remember the Israelites who begged Moses, �Speak to us yourself but do not have God speak to us or we will die.� (Ex 20:19) Simon had a glimpse of God�s holiness, he realised that before Jesus he was nothing but a lowly sinner. Simon perhaps could have thought that he is better than this or that person. He was hard working, respectable and moral and didn�t do harm to others like the tax collectors. But, before Jesus� holy and divine nature, he found how groundless his pride and righteousness were. He found himself utterly unworthy. He couldn�t but kneel at Jesus� feet. 

What grace did Jesus give Simon? Look at verse 10b. Then Jesus said to Simon, �Don�t be afraid; from now on you will catch men.� Jesus said do not be afraid. Before the holiness of God we have every reason to be afraid. Ligon Duncan said this, �Hell is eternity in the presence of God, Heaven is eternity in the presence of God with a mediator.� Jesus allows us to be able to come in the presence of God without fear because he forgives us. Jesus was saying to Peter, �I love you. I am on your side. I�m going to be with you.� Also, Jesus gave him a new life direction by saying, �from now on you will catch men.�  Jesus called him with a clear hope. So far Simon had caught fish. But from now on he would catch men. Catching fish was not easy. Simon had to train hard and learn how to do so. His hope was in catching more fish and better fish. He even risked his life to catch fish. He was happy when he caught many fish, but if he caught nothing, he was miserable. Like Simon, many people also want to catch different types of fish: money, fame and power. They work hard to catch good fish they despair when they fail, yet even when they succeed they despair because of their inner emptiness and meaninglessness. 

�From now on you will catch men.� From now on, means for Simon a new beginning. Until then Simon had caught fish in order to eat them but now he would catch men in order to save them for Jesus. In that sense to catch men is life saving work. Fish start to die from the moment they are caught, but men start to be revived from the moment Jesus catches them. New life starts to grow and blossom from the point of being caught from the sea of sin and death. People who were under the power of sin can be changed into holy disciples of Jesus. Though it is not easy to catch men, still there are many people like Simon Peter in the university. Like Simon Peter, many of them do not have spiritual desire straight away. Jesus however continually helped Simon with hope. And when the time came, he challenged Simon to obey his word. When Simon experienced the divine nature of Jesus and also found himself, Jesus gave him a clear direction for him to catch men. 

The life of catching fish is oriented to oneself in that it is for personal gain, but the life of catching men is for the God�s glory. People in the world struggle hard to catch fish for themselves. How much more then should we struggle to catch men for God�s glory? Jesus was tempted for 40 days to fulfil his mission. He knelt down early in the morning to receive the power of Holy Spirit. He loved the word of God and had deep loved for every human soul. Though at first Simon didn�t look hopeful he served him to the end. Jesus raised his twelve disciples with hope and vision. Catching men and raising them up as Jesus� disciples is the most meaningful and beautiful thing one can do in one�s life. To serve this mission, we need to be prepared. We need to have the desire to catch men and pray hard like Jesus. We need to go out and put out the net of the gospel continually. Though we may experience continued failures, we should not despair but keep putting out the nets again and again. When we do so, we can catch men and raise them up as disciples of Jesus and spiritual leaders. 

What was Jesus� hope and vision for Simon? Simon confessed that he had worked all night but could not catch any fish. His whole life could have ended like this. Yet, Jesus understood his emptiness and meaninglessness. He understood Simon�s inner despair and had compassion for him. And he called Simon as a fisher of men. From the human point of view, he was only a fisherman from Galilee. Yet, Jesus had a vision to raise him up as his apostle and spiritual leader for his generation.

How did Simon react when he was called by Jesus? Look at verse 11. They left everything and followed Jesus. Leaving everything behind and following Jesus was a big adventure. But, Simon held on to Jesus� vision and hope and followed him. Because of this decision, Simon could become a great fisher of men. 

In conclusion, Jesus says us � �Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.� Though we may fail again and again, Jesus wants us not to rely on our experience, knowledge or reason, but rely on his word and obey him. Through this, he wants us to experience the power of faith and invites us to know him more deeply and personally. Jesus wants to bless our lives by giving us the mission to catch men. May God help us to obey his call and be used to catch men in our generation.
