2010 Acts 12 

REMAIN TRUE TO THE FAITH, Paul's first missionary journey (2)

Acts 14:1-28 
Key verse: Acts 14:22
 ''strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. 'We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,' they said.'

Today's message continues with the latter part of Paul's first missionary journey. Paul had left Syrian Antioch and travelled to Cyprus and then gone to the mainland moving to the Roman province of Galatia. He travelled inland to Pisidian Antioch. Until now his journey had gone relatively smoothly. But now in chapter 14 we see greater persecution as he pioneers Iconium, Lystra and Derbe. It's encouraging to read of pioneering new cities and of God's ministry growing but here we see the cost. It was not easy and they suffered yet God worked powerfully when they remained true to the faith. My prayer is that we may learn the spirit of Paul and Barnabas who preached the gospel while suffering. May we learn their wisdom to strengthen the disciples who accepted the gospel. 

Look at verse 1. 'At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Gentiles believed.' In the last part of chapter 13, Paul and Barnabas shook the dust from their feet in protest against the Jews who did not accept the gospel and travelled to Iconium. This is nearly 100 miles south east of Pisidian Antioch. It was an ancient city said to pre-date Damascus. Today it is Turkey's fourth largest city, known as Konya. Although it was a pagan city there was a significant number of Jews that had established synagogues and built a community. Paul and Barnabas came to a new city but started with those who they had some degree of knowledge about. Their strategy was as usual to start by attending the Sabbath service at the Jewish synagogue. In short they began with those they knew and had some links with. It's the same today ' start where you are and with who you know. Moses was telling me in the week about how he came to London and for the first two years started the ministry with those he already had some link with such as Daniel. Paul and Barnabas stood up and preached the gospel. They spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Gentiles believed. The gospel is the power of God and those who believe received the grace of forgiveness through the wonderful gospel truth and were converted to Christianity. But there were some Jews who did not obey the truth. They were active opponents to the gospel. They stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. We might imagine that they would flee but notice in verse 3 that Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time in Iconium. The KJV says 'therefore' they stayed. Rather than run from the devil's attack they stayed and spoke boldly for the Lord. It seems they knew that God was working powerfully and they would not be put off by persecution. When they did this the Lord confirmed the message by enabling them to do miraculous signs and wonders (3). Yet this division grew. As time passed, the people of the city were divided into two. Some sided with the Jews others with Paul and Barnabas. Notice in verse 5 the strange alliance that forms. Gentiles and Jews together with the political leaders of the area. Jews and Gentiles together was not a usual alliance but just as the Pharisees and Sadducees united against Jesus, they came together against Paul and Barnabas to make a plot to ill-treat them and stone them. Whereas before they stayed this time when they found out about the plot they fled. They knew that there was a time to advance and a time to retreat. Just as Jesus had shown, they wisely escaped. (Luke 4:30, Matthew 16:13, 18:4)

The fled to Lystra and Derbe. These were quiet backwater towns but they continued to preach the gospel. The second city in this chapter, Lystra, was about 18 miles south of Iconium. Lystra had been made a Roman colony by Augustus in 25 BC. It served as a base to suppress marauders from the Taurus Mountains who threatened Roman peace. It meant the leaders of the city were Roman soldiers and most of the people were uneducated Lycaonian natives who used their own language. Unlike Iconium there were hardly any Jews living. Timothy came from there and his mother was a Jewess but evidently there were less than 10 Jewish people needed to form a synagogue. (16:2-3; 2Tim 1:5). So how would God work to start a church here? Look at verse 8: 'In Lystra there sat a man crippled in his feet, who was lame from birth and had never walked.' There was a disabled man who had not walked from birth. Medically he could not be healed. But he could listen to Paul's message as he spoke near the temple. It seems that he earnestly listened to Paul's message and was humble and open to what he had to say. Paul looked directly at him and saw he had faith to be healed (9). Look at verse 10. '[He] called out, "Stand up on your feet!" At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.' Paul spoke with a loud voice. 'Stand up on your feet!' Why did Paul call out? It seems that Paul wanted to encourage his faith and give him the assurance that he could be healed. When Paul boldly commanded him to stand he made the decision to faith to obey Paul. He did not simply stand quietly but immediately jumped up and began to walk. This miracle is very similar to that described in Chapter 3 when Peter healed the crippled man sitting by the temple gate called Beautiful. Just as that took place by the Jewish temple this healing took place by a Gentile temple. Just as the miracle established Peter as an apostle to the Jews this established Paul as an apostle to the Gentiles. 

God worked powerfully. It shocked the people that the crippled man who never walked before was suddenly jumping and walking but this demonstrated the power of God. Look at verses 11 and 12.  'When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us in human form!" Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.' Paul had probably preached the gospel in Greek. Yet when this miracle happened the crowd shouted in their Lycaonian language. When people were shocked or in a hurry, they tend to speak in their mother tongue. They shouted "The gods have come down to us in human form!"  Greek and Roman mythology often involved the Gods acting like men and who would sometimes come down to earth. The leading god was Zeus (the Roman name was Jupiter) and his spokesman was Hermes (Roman name Mercury). The people in Lystra called Barnabas, Zeus. It seems he had a long beard and a more dignified bearing. Paul who talked a lot and was small they called Hermes. 

Look at verse 13. 'The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.' The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city heard the news and brought bulls and wreaths. At that time, people offered bulls with wreaths to Zeus. Until this point, Paul and Barnabas did not know what was going on because they could not understand the Lycaonian language. But when the priest brought bulls with wreaths they started to understand what was going on and that the people were going to worship them as gods. 

This seems quite comic to us. But this was a subtle attack of the devil. Having tried force in the past the devil now tries flattery. There are examples of people who have been welcomed as gods and it's proved hugely corrupting. Captain James Cook arrived at Hawaii. The people welcomed him as the god, Lono, and he and his men were given anything and everything. And that means everything they wanted. They were attended day and night and the sailors took advantage of the native population. But strangely, though Captain Cook thought this was wonderful and accepted their worship, one day as they were about to launch their boats and return to their ship, a native who was angry with him for some reason grabbed hold of the captain. Without thinking, Captain Cook swung at him and knocked him down. The native retaliated, hitting him on the head with a club, and the Captain groaned. When the natives heard this, one of them cried out, "He groans. He is not a god!" and they fell on him, and killed him. The temptation for Paul would be to enjoy people's flattery and populatirity or even to use people's misunderstanding to preach the gospel.

Yet how did they receive the attention? Look at verse 15-17.  "Men, why are you doing this? We too are only men, human like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them. In the past, he let all nations go their own way. Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy." They made it clear that they too were only men, human like them. The two apostles made it clear that they were not the objects of worship. Instead the used this as an opportunity to tell them the gospel so that they might turn from the worthless things; worshipping Zeus a man-made god, to the living God who created all things. 

We see here Paul's preaching to people who know nothing about scripture. He started with the truth of God they already knew, creation. Even without scripture, how did God reveal himself? First, he gave people rain from heaven and crops in their seasons (17). Second, God provided them with plenty of food and filled their hearts with joy. This description is the same as in Acts 17:24-29 and Romans 1:19-20. This is the revelation of God from nature and His general grace to people. Because the Creator God reveals Himself through nature, people can acknowledge him through this to some extent. For example, when people see flowers growing in a greenhouse, everybody knows that a greenhouse is made by man. But people don't recognize God who made the whole of nature which is far bigger than a greenhouse. Though people eat food that God provides and live under his grace they don't know God. At certain period of our life this is perhaps clearer ' say when a child or old and facing death. But the point is creation points to God. Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them (18). 

Then what happened after this incident? Look at verse 19. 'Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.' Here some Jews from Antioch were those who earlier talked abusively against Paul and expelled Paul and Barnabas from their region by stirring the Gentiles (13:44-50). They were also the Jews from Iconium who had plotted to stone them by stirring up Gentiles and political leaders. This is incredible zeal. The distance between Antioch and Lystra is about 70 km ' they were persistent in their persecution. They stirred up the crowd. Perhaps they said that two apostles would destroy the religion of Lystra. Just as the Hawaiian locals turned against Captain Cook the people changed from near worship of Paul and Barnabas as gods to violence. Look at verse 19b. 'They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.' Though this account is brief we can see that they attacked Paul and stoned him. Paul who had been involved in stoning Stephen became the one who now was stoned. We do not know why Barnabas was not stoned. May be he disappeared or they were still worried that he was Zeus. We do not know. But the attack was now violent and Paul became unconscious. He must have been bruised and bleeding. He definitely looked dead. So the people of Lystra dragged him outside the city. The zeal shown by Paul in persecuting believers was just as strong in these Jewish persecutors. Just as Jesus had said when calling Paul ' 'I will show him how much he must suffer for my name' (Ac 9:16).

Look at verse 20a. 'But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up' Here the disciples were those new believers converted through Paul and Barnabas in Lystra. It seemed that they came to where Paul's body had been dragged to confirm his death and hold a funeral for him. The disciples must have been fearful and anxious as they looked at Paul's stoned body and perhaps wondered if they would be next. Yet what happened? Although Paul looked dead he suddenly moved and stood up. The disciples perhaps thought he was resurrected! They could hardly speak from awe and joy. It seemed that God protected Paul and by Gods' grace he recovered quickly. He wiped the blood from his face, shook the dust from his clothing and entered the city again! What incredible courage! He was sure that God would protect him. I imagine that this was a great witness to the people, as it seems that when he returned no one who tried to stone him again. 

He stayed that night in the city and the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe. This was a smaller town about 30 km southeast of Lystra. Luke tells us little except that Paul and Barnabas preached the gospel in Derbe and won a large number of disciples. There was no persecution in Derbe. Perhaps after the stoning the Jews had returned to Antioch and Iconium, thinking that Paul was dead. It meant they could preach in freedom as verse 21a tells us 'they won a large number of disciples' indicating Paul's first missionary journey was successful. 

This was the last city of Paul's missionary journey. He is now near his hometown of Tarsus. There was a valley called the Cilician gate or Cilician pass in the east of Derbe that could take him home. It would also be easy to take a ship to Syrian Antioch from Tarsus. But what route did Paul and Barnabas choose? Look at verse 21b. 'Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch,' They chose to return the same way that they had come. What was the reason for this? Look at verses 22-23: 'strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God," they said. Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.' They wanted to strengthen the disciples. Even though they had to flee from Iconium and Lystra because of persecution their concern was to strength the disciples. The disciples who saw them must have been anxious and fearful that they could be attacked. In the midst of trials, the disciples needed to be strengthened in their hearts. In particular how did Paul and Barnabas help the disciples? 

First they encouraged them to remain true to the faith. They visited the disciples and strengthened them and helped them to be rooted in the gospel and to remain true to the faith. The temptation was to give up or ease off. By returning they helped them to stand on the gospel truth of Jesus' death and resurrection. Jesus is the only way. Jesus is the only life and the only truth. The Christian life is more than merely being converted; it is growing in Christ. The disciples needed to be strengthened by the word and encouraged to remain. Then they would be able to bear the fruit of the gospel. 

Second, as well as strengthening and encouragement Paul and Barnabas taught them the meaning of suffering. Look at verse 22b. 'We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God.' To enter the kingdom of God does not necessarily mean personal salvation; it can also mean to expand the territory of the Kingdom of God and conquer the world with the gospel of Jesus.  It means that in order to keep faith and to preach the gospel in this world, there will be hardship and struggle. We should not be surprised at suffering and painful trial (1 Peter 4:12, 1 Jn 3:13). The Apostle Paul had many hardships but he kept his faith to the end until, in his final letter, he could say, 'For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day'and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.' (2 Tim 4:6-8) Today we also have many hardships in order to live by faith. Yet don't give up! In the midst of hardships, hold on to the faith. We must be rooted in the gospel truth. Above all, we must know that in order to enter the kingdom of God, we face many hardships and make a decision to go through them by faith. In order to this, we need hope in the kingdom of God. May God pour into our heart burning hope in the kingdom of God every day.

Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch. When they arrived there, what did they do? Look at verses 27-28. 'On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles. And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.' Can you imagine the excitement of the report of their first journey? The whole church must have been eager to hear. In this report, they did not talk about how much they suffered. They did not boast about what they had done. No. They reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles. Though Paul and Barnabas had risked of their own lives, they testified that it was God who made the trip successful. Outwardly they received a lot of suffering. Outwardly it seemed that the persecutors had won. But this was not so. Paul and his companion testified to God's grace that he opened the door of faith to the Gentiles. In gospel work, there is always persecution. There are always persecutors. It is always hard and there is always suffering. We must know that such things exist for a while and disappear. The history of God's salvation work continues despite such hindrance. Paul and Barnabas stayed in the Antioch church for a long time, perhaps 1 or 2 years, as they rested and prepared for the second missionary journey. No doubt this was a time of refreshment.

In conclusion, Paul and Barnabas preached the gospel despite their lives being threatened. They did not stop the gospel work when suffering. They remained true to the faith and encouraged others to go through many hardships in order to enter the kingdom of God. May God help us serve the work of God with this spirit! May God help us to gladly bear the hardships to raise disciples until we enter the kingdom of God.
