THE KING WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

Luke 19:28-48
Key verse 19:38
�Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!�
Today�s passage has a party atmosphere. In it we see Jesus entering Jerusalem on a colt whilst around him his disciples celebrate the coming of their king. This is a key moment in history because it is the beginning of Jesus� entry into the city where he will die and rise again to save us from sin and death. The disciples praised Jesus their king. Jesus is also our king and our saviour. I pray that we would remember Jesus is our king and praise Jesus, who has saved us from sin and death and given us eternal life with him. 
Look at verse 28; �After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. � Jesus was on the edge of Jerusalem and going on �ahead�, leading his disciples into the city. Jesus is focused on where he is going because he knows that he must be in Jerusalem in order to face his trial and crucifixion in less than a week from this time. He was focused on this because through his crucifixion Jesus would save the world from sin and death. 
Look at verses 29 to 31; �As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no-one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it.'� Again Jesus is very clear but these instructions sound mysterious. How could Jesus know that there was a colt in the village? How could he be sure that his disciples would pick the right one and that the people of the village will not stop them?  
Given an instruction like this many people would refuse but in this passage there are three things which show the disciples saw Jesus as their king. The first is the obedience of these two disciples. The great thing about them is that they did not question Jesus� instructions but simply obeyed them. This became a blessing to them because everything worked out just as Jesus said it would. When these two men trusted Jesus they were able to see a miracle. Consequently the disciples had an opportunity to grow in their faith and Jesus would be glorified. 
It may have appeared reasonable to disobey Jesus� command because taking the colt seemed like theft. But Psalm 24:1-3 says; �The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it�� The colt, like all things, belonged to Jesus and the owners of the colt recognised this. When they allowed the disciples to take the donkey they acknowledged Jesus as their Lord for whom they were willing to give anything. 
Jesus does not generally send us to get donkeys which belong to other people. What he does ask us to do is talk to people about him. We feel uncomfortable about following Jesus� instruction because we think we are intruding on people�s time which belongs to them. But the Lord needs it. Jesus has entrusted us with an important mission and when we obey we see miracles happen. When we obey Jesus, people do give their time. When people give their time they hear the gospel, Jesus is glorified and there is an opportunity for someone to be saved. 
What these verses also teach us is that Jesus is God who knows everything. Jesus knew exactly what was happening, every step of the way to the cross. Luke emphasises this in order to remind us that nothing happened by accident. He is telling us that Jesus knew all that would happen and that he chose to die on the cross because he loves us and wants to save us. 
Look at verse 35; �They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.� Now we see what Jesus wanted to do with the colt. He got onto it and rode it, using the cloaks of his disciples as a saddle. Zechariah 9:9 tells us why he chose to enter Jerusalem in this way: �Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.� Zechariah tells us very clearly that the righteous king will enter Jerusalem on a colt to bring salvation. Therefore Jesus rode a colt to fulfil this prophecy about him. This would have been a very clear sign to the disciples that Jesus was their Messiah and king.  
To really understand this we need to think about what Zechariah�s prophecy actually meant. Ever since The Fall, men have been separated from God by sin. Because of this there is no way for men to be with God and all men must die. However immediately after The Fall God promised that he would return his lost children to him. This is why God sent his perfect, righteous son, Jesus into the world. This was the only way to bridge the gap between man and God and save us from sin and death. Therefore when Zechariah prophesied about the king coming to the Daughter of Jerusalem, he was talking about Jesus coming as a king to take Jerusalem as his bride. Revelation uses the same language to describe the end of time; �I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.� (Rev 21:2). 
The Bible paints for us a picture of a wedding with Jesus as the groom and Jerusalem as the bride. Jerusalem represents all those people who recognise Jesus as their king, God and saviour. It is all those people who rejoice and praise Jesus, it was the disciples, it is the church, it is you and I. Therefore we can praise God like the disciples because we are awaiting our marriage to Jesus, our return to God and to the Kingdom of Heaven.
This image of Jesus on a colt was a very clear sign that the king had come to rescue his people. The Jews were expecting a king because throughout the Old Testament God had promised he would send a Messiah. At the same time the whole world is crying out for a king to save them. Right now, all over the world, people are starving, sick, poor, malnourished, lost, hopeless, frightened, depressed, miserable and dying. This is the normal state of the world and people across the world ask themselves and one another why the world is like this. They ask; who will save us from this hard, meaningless, painful life? People tend to think that their problems are material or social so they try to solve them through relationships, money or activity. Others put their faith in worldly kings who will come riding in to save them. Right now the people of Libya have great expectations for their new government but however good they are they will not answer the deepest needs of their people. 
When people think that their problems will be solved simply through worldly solutions they misunderstand the true nature of their problem. As Paul says in Ephesians; �our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against� the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.� Deep down, whether they realise it or not our fundamental problem is sin and each one of us is crying out for God to save. St Augustine said; �You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.� The people of this world are restless, waiting for their king and Jesus is the king they are waiting for. 
What was the disciples� reaction to seeing Jesus on the donkey? Look at verses 35 and 36; �They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.  As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.� This is the second sign that the disciples were worshipping Jesus as their king. They took their cloaks and laid them on the colt and on the road. A man�s cloak was very valuable. People only owned one and they would use it all the time as a coat or as a shelter if they had to sleep outside at night. Putting their cloak on or under a donkey meant that it could be torn or dirty yet the disciples gladly did this because they were so joyful at the coming of their king. They were so grateful they would give even this most vital possession to acknowledge Jesus� grace and love and give thanks to him.
Look at verses 37 and 38; �When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen: Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!� The third sign that the disciples had accepted Jesus as their king was that they praised God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen Jesus do. They cried out; �Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!� and; �Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!� 
We can imagine who was in the crowd. Lazarus who Jesus had raised from the dead. Zaccheus whose life Jesus had completely changed. Levi who had been called from the tax booth, maybe some of the lepers Jesus had cured or Mary Magdalene from whom Jesus had cast out 7 demons. The twelve disciples were there praising Jesus for all that they had seen him do. They were singing, dancing, waving palm branches, maybe banging on tambourines. There was a party atmosphere just like people attending a wedding. Jesus, the king had come and he had brought salvation into the lives of these people.  
The crowd cried out �Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord.� They were probably thinking of David and a new Messianic kingdom. They still did not understand the crucifixion. But Jesus had already changed their lives. He had already taken them from meaningless, hopeless lives and given new life in him. They did not yet understand that Jesus would also save the whole world but they praised him because he had saved them. 
The disciples also cried out; �Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!� When Jesus was born the angels sang about peace on earth but now the disciples sang of peace in heaven. This sounds strange because we think there is always peace in heaven. However, there can be no peace in God�s heart so long as his children are separated from him by sin. Like the father of the prodigal son God is constantly seeking his lost children, waiting for them to come home. Yet only through Jesus� death on the cross did it become possible for all men to return to God. Therefore as Jesus rode into Jerusalem to take the cross he was bringing peace in heaven as God would finally be reconciled with men. 
We can also praise God for the miracles we have seen. Each of us was a lost sinner who was found. When I think back to my old life I was a miserable, selfish, lustful man with no sense of meaning or direction in my life. Each of us suffered in the same way because of our sin. The nature of our worship now reflects how much we remember what Jesus has done to overcome this. People who have a deep sense of their sin and of the love, grace and forgiveness of Jesus worship him openly, wholeheartedly and joyfully. When we remember Jesus who saved us from our sin we worship through our obedience, through our giving and through praising him with our voices as the disciples did. However the less we remember Jesus love for us, the less we obey, the less we give, the less we sing out in joy.  
The danger is that as we grow older the time before we knew Jesus seems further away and we forget who we were. Yet we are still sinners and each day as we bring our sin before Jesus we can give thanks that he does not give us the punishment we deserve for them. If this is what our praise is like and we are finding it hard to praise and worship God then we need to remind ourselves again of who we are and what Jesus has done for us. The disciples� praise ought to be a picture of the praise of all Christians. As they called out in joy the people around them would have heard and joined in. When we are filled with joy in our relationship with Jesus it spills out to the other people around us who see our obedience, our giving and our praise. As a result people become curious, they want to know about the source of our joy and they come to join in our praise and worship of the king. In this Jesus is glorified and the church grows as people share our joy in Jesus. 
Those who have not accepted Jesus at all don�t worship but grumble and complain. These are people who have chosen to spend eternal life in hell. This is the choice the Pharisees were making. Look at verse 39; �Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, Teacher, rebuke your disciples!� The crowd was full of joy but we cannot see any joy in these men. They were standing watching God who loves them so much that he would humble himself to ride on a donkey and go to the cross to save them. They were watching the fulfilment of a prophecy, right before their eyes. Yet their response was just to criticise Jesus� disciples. How did Jesus respond? Look at verse 40; �I tell you, he replied, if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.� Jesus� response to them was to explain that the desire for an end to separation from God is not just to do with people but the whole of creation. The stones would cry out because the whole universe is waiting for man to be reconciled with God. Romans 8:22 says �We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.� What the Pharisees were witnessing was the pivotal moment in history that the whole universe, even the stones had been waiting for, yet all they could do was criticise because they had rejected Jesus and chosen Satan as their king. 
Look at verses 41 and 42; �As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, �If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace� but now it is hidden from your eyes.�� Here we see the atmosphere change completely. Jesus was at the centre of a joyful wedding parade but suddenly we see him stop and weep at the sight of Jerusalem. It may seem inconsistent for Jesus to both rejoice and weep but both joy and weeping are the result of Jesus� love. Jesus loves the world and every person in it. He rejoices with those who choose to accept his invitation to live for eternity in the kingdom of heaven but he weeps for those who choose to reject him and spend eternity in hell. As he looked at Jerusalem he wept for its people who would suffer so much because they had rejected Jesus. In verses 43 and 44 he spoke about the sacking of the city in AD70 when the Romans would build siege ramps around the city, kill a million people and leave no two stones on top of one another. Verse 44 says that the people and their children would be dashed to ground. Their suffering would be terrible and Jesus told them that the reason for their suffering would be; ��because you did not recognise the time of God�s coming to you.� The same suffering will befall all people who do not recognise God�s coming into their lives. God gives people the opportunity to accept eternal life. But those who choose to reject him and accept Satan as their king will suffer eternal damnation in hell. 
Jesus could have been angry with those people who had rejected him. But Jesus knows better than anyone what hell is like and the punishment which all those who reject him will suffer therefore he wept. This is also why Jesus calls us to go out to preach the gospel to students in this generation. Jesus wants us to weep for students. When we go to UCL and people reject us we feel angry and like James and John we want to call down fire from heaven on people. Yet Jesus wants us to weep for them in love because of the suffering they will face as a result of their decision. We need to have Jesus� broken heart for those who do not know him and keep struggling to bring the word of God to them. 
In conclusion. I pray that we would be the joyful crowd of disciples who rejoice in Jesus� love for us. Let us remember that we are undeserving sinners and that Jesus has changed us through all the miracles we have seen him do. Let us live lives of obedience, giving and praise for Jesus who saved us. At the same time let us weep in love for those who have rejected Jesus. May our celebration of his love for us be the way for others to come to him. When we rejoice in Jesus may others see us and also praise Jesus.
