2010 Acts 13


SALVATION THROUGH THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS

Acts 15:1-35
Key Verse: Acts 15:11 
'No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.'

In chapters 13 and 14, we saw Paul and Barnabas, during their first missionary journey, pioneering the gentile world with the gospel. After which they returned to Antioch and reported how God had opened the door of faith to the gentiles. In this chapter a dispute on circumcision occurs just before their second missionary journey. Paul and his companions debated with the Jewish believers concerning the salvation of the Gentiles. This brought about the first reported Council meeting at Jerusalem during which they affirmed the gospel truth that, only by grace can one be saved. Through this, Paul's gentile mission gains great momentum. Through this passage, may we learn again and accept in our hearts that salvation is only by grace.

Look at verse 1. 'Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the brothers: "Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.' Some people came down from Judea to Antioch and taught the brothers there. They were Jewish believers from Jerusalem who held fast to Jewish tradition. They pressed upon them their idea that the Gentile should be circumcised in order to be saved. Historically and Biblically circumcision was simply a sign of being a part of God's covenant people. Yet as time went by the Jews had lost the original spirit of the law and became bound by the form. To the point where they thought that one cannot be saved without circumcision. 

This teaching caused a great disturbance in the church at Antioch. Up to this point they had been standing only upon pure Gospel faith but it seemed now that they needed something extra. Verse 1 only mentions circumcision, yet Later in this passage we see that they were, in fact, laying upon them the burden of the whole law. (10,29) Such ideas would have shaken the faith of the Antioch church. This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with the Jewish believers. The whole church considered this to be a significant issue that could effect the whole Gentile mission. So they sent Paul and Barnabas along with some other believers to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem church. They wanted to hear the opinion of their mother church in Jerusalem. 

Look at verse 3. 'The church sent them on their way, and as they travelled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the brothers very glad.' They must have been sent with a hope that the pure gospel truth would be approved in Jerusalem. On their way Paul and his companions visited the churches in Phoenicia and Samaria and encouraged them with news of God's work. This journey was about 500kms, an exhausting journey, yet they were gospel workers preaching the gospel and strengthened the disciples wherever they went.

Look at verse 4. 'When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.' They were welcomed by the church, the apostles and elders. When Paul visited the Jerusalem church for the first time (Acts 9:26-30), he was received coldly and with suspicion but this time, after his first missionary journey, he was warmly welcomed. They reported the fruit of their mission journey. Their emphasis was not on their own sufferings and hardships but on 'everything God had done through them'. They testified that the Gentile mission was God's mission accomplished through God's direct intervention. By giving them this message they were telling them that any opponent of the Gentile mission was an opponent of God. 

The mission work that we partake in every day is the work of God. Very often though, we talk about what we have done and how much we have to suffer. Like Paul we need to see beyond ourselves with spiritual eyes and see what God is doing among us. When we talk about the work of God we can all be greatly encouraged. 
While Paul was testifying, some of the believers became upset. They belonged to the party of the Pharisees. Standing up, they insisted that the Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the Law of Moses. Look at verse 6. 'The apostles and elders met to consider this question.' This was the first recorded council meeting since the beginning of Christian church history. The two main topics that were on the table were, firstly the anger of some Jewish believers who found it offensive that the gentiles did not adhere to the law and still reckoned that they could be saved, without the council finding a compromise there may have been a split in the church between Jew and Gentile believers. Secondly was issue of salvation, if the right decision was not made here the gentile mission would have lost power and momentum. 
Look at verse 7. 'After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: "Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.' At first there was much discussion. We don't know how long this discussion lasted, it could have been hours or even days, yet what we can learn is that when there is a serious spiritual matter we should take time to discuss it. Afterwards Peter got up. The people must have listened intently to what he had to say. What was his address? Look at verses 7b-11. "Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. He made no distinction between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are." 
What was Peter saying through his message to the Jewish believers? 
Firstly, God had revealed to Peter himself that the Gentiles must hear the message of the gospel. This refers to the incident in chapter 10:1-48 when God showed him a vision and told him to 'kill and eat' He obeyed those words by going to Cornelius' house and preaching the gospel to the gentiles there. 
Secondly, God gave the Holy Spirit to the Gentiles. When Peter spoke the word in Cornelius' house, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. The fact that God gave the Holy Spirit to the uncircumcised Gentiles who did not live by law revealed that God had given them salvation through faith alone. 
Thirdly, God made no distinction between Jew and gentile, and purified their hearts by faith. Regardless of whether they keep the law or not, God saw their faith and purified their hearts. 
Fourthly, they were putting on the gentiles necks a yoke that neither they nor their fathers had been able to bear.  God had seen the suffering of his people under the law, he had seen mans weakness and inability to keep it, so, in his mercy had saved them by the grace of Jesus. To lay the law on the gentiles was fruitless and also revealed that they doubted the power of God's grace to save
Lastly and as a conclusion he made it clear that both the Jews and the Gentiles were saved only by the grace of Jesus. Peter himself had seen the Holy Spirit coming upon Cornelius and converting him, so he was 100% sure of this.
All became silent after Peter's speech. The Jews couldn't reply back. Then Barnabas and Paul stood up. They told about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. Through their personal testimony, they stated the clear fact that the Gentiles were saved only by faith in the gospel. Their testimony backed up Peter's speech. After Peter's speech and Barnabas and Paul's testimony the whole assembly became even more silent. 
After this James, Jesus' brother and the chair of the council, spoke up. The whole church listened to him. Look at verses 14-21 'Simon has described to us how God at first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for himself. The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:" 'After this I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it, that the remnant of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things' that have been known for ages. "It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath." 
Here James begins by calling Peter, Simon showing the intimacy among the Jews in the assembly. He then quoted a prophesy in Amos (9:11,12) that God would rebuild David's fallen tent so that the remnant of men and the Gentiles might seek the Lord. He testified that the Scripture foretold the Gentiles would be God's people and now that time had come. Secondly, James, as the chair of the council, makes his conclusion. He insists that they should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God by demanding that they be circumcised or keep the law. That means the Gentles are saved only by faith and do not need to put on a yoke of law. However, as the Jews were still deeply rooted in the law, in order to keep peace between the Jewish and Gentile believers he recommended a couple of restriction that would appease the Jews: They should abstain from food polluted by idols (sacrificed to idols verse 29), from sexual immorality, which was rampant among many of the Gentiles, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. At that time there were leaders in every city who read the law of Moses in the synagogues on every Sabbath. The Jewish believers could not simply give up their culture. So in order not to stir them up and to create peaceful relationship among the believers, James recommended those things. 
This declaration, that the Gentiles also are only saved by faith, was a historical moment. Through the discussion, Peter's speech, Barnabas and Paul's testimony and James' conclusion; the Christian truth that the Gentiles are saved by faith and grace alone was ratified. This decision made the foundation for the world mission.
We are all sinners who deserve to be cut of from God, face his judgement and condemnation, yet God himself has saved us by his one sided grace, he has justified us through his son. When we are first saved our sense of God's grace is overwhelming, yet as time goes by that grace can easily fade and law creeps in. When we fail or fall to temptation time and time again we can start to think that we have lost God's grace and that we have to somehow earn our way back into God's salvation. We can think that if we work hard or do good, God will forgive us and we can affirm our salvation. But this is our very own Judaism. Jesus has paid it all, he said on the cross 'It is finished' We must keep coming back to the cross of Jesus and accept in our hearts that we are saved by grace alone. 
Look at verse 22. 'Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were leaders among the brothers.' The apostles, elders and the whole church accepted James' resolution. They chose Judas and Silas as the delegates to send to the Antioch church with Paul and Barnabas. The council wrote a letter that confirmed the resolution of the Jerusalem church. 'The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings. We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul' men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things.'

What does the letter tell the Antioch church? First, though the issue was brought from the Antioch church, the recipients are the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia. In other words this applied to all the Gentile churches. Second, those who disturbed them and troubled their minds were not sent by the Jerusalem church. Therefore the Gentile church didn't need to take on board what they said. Third, the Jerusalem church called Barnabas and Paul their dear friends. This acknowledgment of Barnabas and Paul would encourage the Gentiles to keep on learning from them and grow spiritually. Fourth, Judas and Silas were representatives from the Jerusalem church would confirm what was written in the letter. Fifth, with consideration for the Jewish believers, they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. These were not law but, if they adhered to them would encourage a virtuous life. 

Just like the gentiles we to have been saved by grace alone. There is nothing that we can do better our salvation, by grace we are saved and that is final. Yet there are things that we can do to better our spiritual life and help us to grow in spiritual maturity. Restricting ourselves from excessive alcohol - getting drunk is never good for the spirit. Abstaining from sexual immorality - giving in to temptation is the sure way to lose spiritual power. Or disciplines such as early Morning Prayer, Daily Bread and reflection writing; these are not laws but when we are faithful to them we can not help but grow spiritually. We must be clear that we are saved only by grace but at the same time we should challenge our spiritual complacency through spiritual disciplines and grow as mature men and women of faith who can serve this generation spiritually.

What should our attitude be when we go through spiritual discipline? Should we look at ourselves? Applaud ourselves when we do well and condemn ourselves when we fail? Not at all! Spiritual discipline and spiritual growth should not be a self-centred activity, rather it should be God centred. John Wesley spoke on spiritual discipline saying: "First, let [fasting] be done unto the Lord with our eye singly fixed on Him. Let our intention herein be this, and this alone, to glorify our Father which is in heaven." Our own spiritual growth brings joy to our souls but more over it brings glory to God our Father. Our focus should not be on ourselves but on God.

Look at verse 28 again. 'It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements:' This decision was made by 'the Holy Spirit and themselves'. The Holy Spirit was the main person who decided the council's verdict. Therefore the gentiles should listen and follow its direction. Through the resolution of the council at Jerusalem Sola Fide was established ' the Christian doctrine of justification by faith. The stumbling blocks for the Gentile mission were removed. Christianity had overcome Judaism and moved forward to the world mission.

Look at verse 30. The representatives went down to Antioch. They gathered the church together and delivered the letter. The people read it and were glad. They immediately accepted the decision of the council at Jerusalem. Judas and Silas, who were prophets, not only delivered the letter but encouraged and strengthened the brothers. Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch and preached the word of the Lord.

In conclusion, Jesus solved sin through his death on the cross and resurrection. God justifies whoever believes in this Jesus. One's justification and salvation is only by God's grace and by faith in Jesus alone. One cannot be saved by law or discipline. Only by grace and only by faith is it possible. Yet spiritual discipline is still necessary, not for salvation, but, for helping us grow in spiritual maturity as God's saved people. May we live as God's saved people by faith and grow through spiritual discipline.
