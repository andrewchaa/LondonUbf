JESUS� EARLY YEARS

Luke 2:21-52
Key Verse 2:49
Why were you searching for me? he asked. Didn�t you know I had to be in my Father�s house?�

We hardly have any record on Jesus� childhood or the time before he starts his ministry. Today�s passage is unique in that it tells us something of his childhood. In this passage, we can see Jesus going into Jerusalem when he was 12 to keep the Passover. We can learn from this event what Jesus� main concern was from his early age.
 
?. People waiting for the consolation of Israel (21-39)
Look at verse 21. �On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived. Circumcision was first commanded for Abraham. It is painful operation but by obeying this command, Abraham made a new decision to live before God as his servant, repenting his unbelief and sin. Jesus was the Son of God. So, he did not need to be circumcised. But, he obeyed the Law and was circumcised. After circumcision, Jesus� parents named him �Jesus�, which means �the Lord saves� in accordance with what the angel said. 
Look at verses 22-24. �When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, (as it is written in the Law of the Lord �Every first born male is to be consecrated to the Lord�) and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the law of the Lord: �a pair of doves or two young pigeons�. Joseph and Mary went to the Jerusalem temple to dedicate Jesus to God 40 days after his birth according to the Law of Moses. The phrases, �as it is written in the law of the Lord� and in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord, and according to the Law of Moses, emphasises how Mary and Joseph were at pains to make sure  they obeyed the scriptures and brought up the child according to God�s law. They were poor, the sacrifices of the doves and pigeons reveal that they could not afford a lamb that normally was offered (Lev 12:1-8). But they were good, devout godly parents, who made sure they did everything to bring their child up according to the law. 

But this raises a question about Jesus as the Son of God. Why was Jesus circumcised and why did they follow all the requirements of the law? As the son of God, why was he under the law? Surely he was without sin so why was he circumcised? Galatians 4:4-5 says, �But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law, that we might receive the full rights as sons� Jesus as the Son of God was born of a woman. He was born human like us. He lowered himself and came into this world in human likeness. And he obeyed the law and was circumcised according to the law on the 8th day. He was without sin, but he did not work outside or against the law or what the Scriptures said, he completely obeyed the law and was completely observant of the Torah. Jesus came to fulfil the law. He went through all this so as to redeem us from our sins. We can thank and praise our Lord Jesus who was born of a woman and obeyed the law to save us who are under the power of law. 

Now we see God testified to who Jesus is through an old man called Simeon, on whom the Holy Spirit was. Look at verse 25 �Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.� He was a righteous man, having nothing to hide from God and men. He also was waiting for the consolation of Israel. Everyone waits for something. Young people in Israel were waiting for their political freedom. Yet, Simeon was waiting for God�s consolation of Israel. In other words, he was waiting for the messiah who could save his people from the agony of sorrow, despair and suffering. He waited for the messiah with patience and longing and hope. The Holy Spirit was pleased with the hope and faith of his life. 

Look at verses 26-27. �It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord�s Messiah. Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required� Jesus as a baby looked like any other baby, but the Holy Spirit moved Simeon to recognised that he was special that he is the messiah. He started to praise him. How does he praise Jesus?

First, Jesus is the Lord�s salvation. Look at verses 30-31. �For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all people.   Simeon praised Jesus that he is God�s salvation whom God prepared for all people.  Everybody in the world has their life problem which they themselves cannot solve. Some people look as if they are free outwardly. However, everybody has their life problem and all wander around in need of their saviour. Jesus is the Saviour God prepared for all people. 

Second, Jesus is a light for the gentiles and the glory of God�s people Israel. Look at verse 32. �a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.  The Gentile world has no light. It is a dark world. In it you can find no direction or meaning for life. People live empty, meaningless lives. Jesus is the light for such a world. Israel was suffering under Roman rule. They were waiting for God�s consolation. The trouble was they were looking for the wrong kind of consolation in political freedom rather than the true glory that God wanted to give them in Jesus, the glory of being his royal priesthood, and to be shepherds to the world. When Jesus comes and shines his light on us, we can also reveal his glory. 

Third, Jesus will be the cause of falling and rising of many. Look at verse 34. �Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against.� Those who do not believe in Jesus and reject him will fall and be destroyed. Yet, those who believe and accept Jesus will rise and prosper. People often think that they can fall or rise based on their ability, motivation or background. However, it depends on our attitude towards Jesus, who is the Lord and King of our life. Jesus reveals who we are through his word of truth. When we repent and accept Jesus, we start to rise again though we fell before. However, those who do not repent, started criticising and rejecting Jesus and finally crucify him on the cross. How would a mother feel like when her son is crucified? Simeon prophesised that a sword would pierce Mary�s soul when it happens.

Look at verses 36-37. �There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.� She lived as a widow for a long time. If she had married at 17, an expected age for those days, it meant that she had lived on her own for 60 years. For that length of time, she had not married again but stayed in the temple day and night. This means that her heart and soul was always with the work of God. Her life reminds us of Ps 84 �How lovely is your dwelling place O Lord Almighty! My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lord; my heart cries out for the living God�. Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere.� Day and night she came to the temple and prayed. She was a true mother of prayer for Israel. Verse 38 shows what she was praying for. It says that she was looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem, the Saviour of Israel. How did God answer her prayer? Finally, she could see Jesus. When she saw Jesus, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were also looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. 

Finally we can think of Simeon and Anna as old people, part of those faithful servants of the Old Testament era, who had all been waiting their whole lives for the saviour to come. We find them both at the temple, both of them recognising the significance of the baby Jesus. With Jesus would come a new era, not of law but of grace, where the temple would no longer be a building by human hands but in each believer�s heart through the Holy Spirit. The fact that these most faithful and Spirit lead servants could know Jesus and prophesy his future impact on the world makes the later rejection of Jesus even less justifiable.
 
Look at verses 39-40. �When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord. They returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.  

?. Jesus who listened and asked questions in the temple (41-52)

Read verses 41-45. Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the feats of the Passover. When he was twelve years old, they went up to the feast, according to the custom. After the feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. Thinking he was in their company, they travelled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. When they id not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.  Every year Jesus� parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. The Passover was the feast to remember how God had rescued the Israelites from the slavery of Egypt. On that day, all Israelites remembered this grace and praised their Saviour God. They also renewed God�s vision and hope for them. Every Israelite from everywhere came to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover.  Jesus� parents also went to Jerusalem for the Passover. This lasted for seven days. When everyone went home after the Passover, however, Jesus still stayed in Jerusalem. His parents had not realized this and went on ahead for a day. Finally they found that Jesus was not with them. They tried their best to find Jesus and eventually went back to Jerusalem. There were so many people and it was not easy to find Jesus. Where did they finally find him? 

Look at verses 46-47. �After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.� People were amazed at Jesus� questions and answers because they were full of inspiration and wisdom. They were amazed how this twelve year old boy could speak with such wisdom and inspiration, staying three days in the temple. He wanted to know more about God and spiritual truth. He had an eager desire to do know God. God gave us a heart�s desire to know him. By knowing God, we can grow as a mature men and women of faith. People who have an eager desire to know God and humbly listen and ask questions with learning minds grow fast, and endlessly. However, those who do not have such desire or have any heart to listen or ask questions cannot grow. Those people are old wine-skins. Though they become old, they will not necessarily grow spiritually.

The boy Jesus was in his teens. It sounds too hard for him to listen and ask about God. However, for three days, he gave his whole heart in listening and asking in the temple. He stayed behind even when his parents left because his heart was fully occupied with the spiritual desire to know God. When our heart is full of spiritual desire, God also pours his wisdom on us. From a young age, John Calvin eagerly wanted to know God. God gave him wisdom and inspiration and enabled him to write the Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536) at the age of 26. Apostle Paul, who was filled with the heavenly inspiration and truth, was able to write numerous letters including Romans. Last week we read his letter to the Philippians 3:7-8, where he confesses, �But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ.� Paul could grow more and more because of his eager desire to know Christ. The fact that Jesus even at the age of 12 had such a strong spiritual desire teaches us also how we should plant faith in the heart of young souls. If they do not have the desire to know God, they can become slaves of sin. Sinful desires will grow instead. Therefore, we should help our young children to have spiritual desire to know God and help them with prayer and word of God. 

Look at verses 48-49. when his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.  why were you searching for me?  he asked. didn�t you know I had to be in my Father�s house?�
  
Mary, Jesus� mother was worried. However, Jesus didn�t say sorry for not coming home. Instead, he said, �Why were you searching for me?  he asked. didn�t you know I had to be in my Father�s house?� Jesus called God his Father and he is the Son of God. He also saw the temple as his Father�s house. He also said that it is natural for him to be in his Father�s house, doing his father�s work. Jesus was only twelve, but he knew who he was, where he should be and what he should live for. He knew that he was not only the son of carpenter Joseph but also the son of God. John Piper says that it�s perhaps significant that Jesus was twelve, as it is in the 12th year that in Jewish custom the boy leaves the teaching of his father and enters full participation in the religious life of the synagogue. This is called the bar mitzvah or �son of the commandment�, where the boy takes on the full yoke of the law.  Perhaps at this time, when a boy traditionally becomes a man, Jesus wanted to subtly show that his relationship to his Father in heaven was unique. Until then he had been known only as the son of carpenter Joseph. Now he set his life purpose in coming close to God and pleasing him. The boy Jesus� foremost concern was to stay in the house of God and his heart was filled with the things of the house of God. 

What is our concern now? Is it to stay in the house of the Lord and to do his work?  Or is it still in the world? If we aim to stay in the house of the Lord and set our heart on doing his work, our heart will be filled with joy, peace and happiness. May God help us to have an inner desire to know him and love him like the young Jesus.

Look at verses 50-52. Jesus� parents could not understand Jesus� words because they were full of the spirit and wisdom from God. But, Jesus went to Nazareth with his parents and was obedient to them. Jesus knew who he was at the age of 12 and was full of desire to know God. From that time on, he clearly knew who he was and what was he called to do. He was full of wisdom and truth. He could have started his ministry right then. Yet, he waited until the age of 30. He lived as a nameless carpenter for 18 years and waited for God�s time. The age of 12 to 30 is the most important time in one�s life. This is time when we lay the foundation of our life. Many people wander around at this time without knowing the direction of their life. Generally, people tend to think more seriously about life and the future of their life and they grow at this time. 

Jesus found his identity early in his life and did not squander his life. He lived a humble and obedient life. Self-denial, patience and perseverance characterize his life and through these his inner character grew. As he grew, he was loved more and more by God and men. Jesus grew as a great servant of God.
