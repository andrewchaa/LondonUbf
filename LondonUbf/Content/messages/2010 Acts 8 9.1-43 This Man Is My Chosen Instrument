2010 Acts 8

This man is my chosen instrument

Acts 9:1-43 
Key Verse 9:15 
'But the Lord said to Ananias, "Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel.'

Today's passage deals with a very crucial period in the history of Christianity. We see Peter's ministry at its peak and also we can see Saul's conversion. The gospel must be preached not only to Jews but also to gentiles. For this reason, God called Saul who was a severe persecutor of the church. May God help us to think of Jesus who calls Saul and renew our grace of calling.

Look at verse 1. 'Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest.' He strongly believed that to root out Christianity was his mission and the way to serve God. He was zealous to fulfill this mission. So, he even asked the high priest for letters to go to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. Josephus recorded that in AD 66, during the persecution by the emperor Nero, around 10,500 Jews were killed in Damascus so we can assume that there would be also many Christians living alongside them in Damascus. Some may have fled from the persecution in Jerusalem and some were probably converted by them. Saul wanted to go anywhere to arrest any Christians. Then, what happened on the way? 
Look at verse 3. 'As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.' Damascus is the capital of Syria and is located 240 km northeast from Jerusalem. Damascus was known as the pearl of the East. Just as he was near by the city, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. This light was greater than that of the sun. (Acts 22:6;26:13). This was a supernatural phenomenon. He fell to the ground and because of the light he could not see. He heard a voice say to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?" This was such a clear voice, yet Saul at first did not know who was speaking, though he felt it was some divine character. So, he asked. "Who are you, Lord?"  At this, he heard the divine voice again. "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," he replied." 
Saul persecuted Christians, yet Jesus said that he was persecuting him. Jesus feels the same pain when the believers are persecuted and going through suffering (Isa 63:9). This is like a father feeling pain when his child goes through suffering. 

Saul did not know what to say when he heard this. At this, what did Jesus say to him? Look at verse 6. Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do." After revealing himself to Saul, Jesus gave him a clear direction. He said that when he went into the city, he would meet someone who could help him know what he must do in the future. What does this mean? This means that regardless of Saul's will, Jesus had already chosen him as his instrument. What happened to Saul is not just some psychological confusion. People who were walking with him also heard the sound but did not see anyone. They also fell to the ground and got up Acts 22:6; 26:13). When they saw Saul, falling to the ground and asking ' who are you Lord, they were astonished and couldn't say anything. Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. 

Look at verse 9. 'For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.' He must have been so shocked. He could not deny that the risen Jesus appeared to him. This was an undeniable fact and truth. His heart must have been deeply troubled. He could no longer be hold to what he had believed and had been so convinced of. It must have been so painful to realise that what he believed so zealously was all wrong. He did not know what to do and could not do anything. So, he prayed earnestly (11). Jesus was with him and showed him another vision, where a man named Ananias would come and place his hands on him to restore his sight (12). If we think of Saul's zeal and passion to destroy Christianity, it seems impossible for him to become a Christian. Yet, Jesus helped him with great patience and care.

Look at verse 10. In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, "Ananias!"  "Yes, Lord," he answered. What did Jesus ask Ananias to do? "Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight." Jesus asked Ananias to go to the house of Judas to restore Saul's sight. How did Ananias react? He was shocked at this because Saul was such a notorious persecutor. He had heard many reports about Saul and all the harm he had done to believers. He also knew that he had come to Damascus with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who called on Jesus' name. But, what did Jesus say to him?

Look at verse 15. 'But the Lord said to Ananias, "Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel.' As Ananias said, Saul had been a sworn enemy of the gospel, yet Jesus said that he would use him as his chosen instrument. Here, the word instrument means the person whom God has personally chosen (Jem 22:28; 51:34). Jesus was saying that he had chosen Saul for his gospel work. Then, who should Saul preach the gospel to? First, before gentiles to those countries outside Judah. Second, to the kings. Here, the kings mean worldly authorities. Later, he testified to Jesus before Caesar and King Agrippa (26). Thirdly, before the Jews. Saul had a deep love for his people. He preached the gospel to the Jews as well as to the gentiles. 

What can we learn from Jesus who calls Saul that it is God who calls his servants according to his sovereignty. Saul was the persecutor of the gospel. Yet, God used even Saul as his precious instrument for world mission. When we think of our own lives, we can't find any good reasons for why God chose us in particular as bible teachers for university students. We were ignorant of the gospel and had no hope of being used by God. We even persecuted the church of God like Saul. Yet, God called us according to his sovereignty. With hope, he sees us and helps us to grow as his servants. When we see students, sometimes we can't see any vision or hope. Yet, we must believe that God can change any person as his chosen instrument. Think of how God preciously used Saul ' the extreme persecutor ' in his redemptive work. May God help us to serve the gospel ministry with this hope and vision 

Humanly, Saul was also very suitable as an apostle for the gentiles. He was from Tarsus, where Greek philosophy flourished. This was also the place where the East met the West. The Roman world view was mixed with oriental mysticism. Saul had a Greek education so he was logical and good at speech. From an early age, he had been brought up to keep the law well. He was educated under Gamaliel. He was one of a minority of Jews who had Roman citizenship and so had no problem going anywhere in the Roman empire. He had many good qualities that could be used for the gentile mission. Jesus not only gave him the mission but also told him of the suffering he would go through. Look at verse 16. 'I will show him how much he must suffer for my name." This means that Saul himself would also suffer a lot as he preached Christ. This shows inevitable persecution every believer goes through.'
 
Look at verse 17. 'Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord'Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here'has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit." Ananias accepted Saul as a brother. This shows that Ananias ' on behalf of Jesus ' forgave all his sins and accepted him as a member of the church. Ananias was truly a man who had Jesus' love. He was obedient to Jesus' words though it was hard. After being welcomed by Ananias, Saul became filled with the Spirit. Not only spiritually, but also physically, his eyes were opened. From then, his past was gone. He was a new creation. Look at verse 19. 'and after taking some food, he regained his strength.' This shows not only that he finished fasting but also that had accepted Jesus' grace of forgiveness. After recovering spiritually and physically, he stayed with believers in Damascus for a few days. He was accepted as a member of church there. Then, at once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. All those who heard him were astonished. God alone can bring such a miracle in one's life. 

After many days had gone by, the Jews conspired to kill him. Day and night they kept a close watch on the city gates in order to kill him. They couldn't let Saul continue to preach about Jesus. But Saul's followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall. This was the first persecution Saul experienced and it fulfilled what Jesus said in verse 16. Saul then went to Jerusalem. There, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. At this, Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.

Look at verse 28-30. 'So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. Saul also talked and debated with the Grecian Jews. Yet, again they tried to kill him. When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.' What happened after this in the church? Look at verse 31. 'Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace.' It was strengthened; and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in number, living in the fear of the Lord. When the notorious persecutor Saul became Jesus' disciple, peace came to the church and the number of believers increased. 

What then was Peter doing while God was calling Saul? Look at verse 32. As Peter travelled about the country, he went to visit the saints in Lydda. Peter went everywhere to preach and visit scattered believers. Now, he visited Lydda, about 40 km northwest from Jerusalem. There he found a man named Aeneas, a paralytic who had been bedridden for eight years. This means that his illness was incurable. Looking at him, Peter said, "Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and take care of your mat." At this, immediately Aeneas got up. All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord. 

Also, in Joppa there was a woman disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas), who was always doing good and helping the poor. About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room. Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him. Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to a room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them. Perhaps, these were what Dorcas made to help the poor. What did Peter do for her? 

He sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. He relied on God alone and prayed. Then, he turned toward the dead woman and said, "Tabitha, get up." She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up. He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called the believers and the widows and presented her to them alive. This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord. 

On the other hand, Peter stayed in Joppa for several days in the house of a tanner named Simon. Tanner cures and prepares animal skins and leather for clothing. This was a profession known as unclean. Yet, the fact that he stayed in Simon's house for several days shows that Peter was overcoming his Jewish prejudice little by little. 

In today's passage, we can see the climax of Peter's life of faith. He healed a paralytic and raised the dead widow. Most of all, he did these miraculous things in the gentile land. This is significant. The author is showing that now the time for gentile mission has come. At this time we see Peter's gentile ministry reaching its peak before Saul, whom God prepared for this particular purpose, becomes the main pioneer of the gentile ministry. Here, we see it is God who calls people according to his sovereign plan. God prepared Saul to bring the gospel to gentiles. 

This passage has made me think again about the two aspects of God's grace on a person's life: the forgiveness of God and God's plan for each person. I think of Saul's life and then my life. No one could have imagined that Saul could change; he was such a zealous opponent of the gospel, so passionate about persecuting the church. He did the most appalling crimes, overseeing Stephen's martyrdom and dragging men and women off to prison. He did this out of ignorance, thinking Jesus had not risen and that Christians were dangerous and needed destroying. It was therefore entirely God's initiative to intervene. Jesus told Saul he had been persecuting him, that his sin and all the terrible suffering he had caused believers was against God himself. It must have been so painful for Saul, to realise his sin, for three days he was left in darkness realising the extent of his destructive behaviour. He was the worst of sinners and yet Jesus forgave him. Jesus' forgiveness of Saul tells us there is no one Jesus cannot forgive. Saul's sense of debt and grace of Jesus' forgiveness was what gave his life of faith such power and conviction.

Secondly, God's grace lay in his plan for Saul's life. Saul had his own plans for his life, he had his own idea of how to serve God. Yet Jesus' plan was very different. Rather than causing the suffering and destruction of others, it would mean a life of suffering for Christ. This was not a life he chose or volunteered for. Jesus chose him. Paul simply had to accept and obey. Yet what amazing grace this was for Saul! Rather than wasting his life, and destroying others, he was called to the most fruitful, precious and influential life he could never have imagined to be an apostle for the gentiles and to be a disciple maker. 

When I think of Jesus' grace of forgiveness and grace of his call on Paul's life I have to remember God's grace on my life. Though I never went out of my way to persecute Christians, I was destructive in my life and the life of others and my sin was against Jesus and God. I wasted my life in rebellion. I rebelled against my parents, rebelled against God's law, was lustful and destructive in my relationship with girls, selfish and proud with my friends and lazy and hedonistic to the point of being kicked out of school for smoking drugs. And yet God called me and forgave me. My sin was against him but he died on the cross for me. Like Saul I never wanted to be a Christian. I even remember praying my first sincere prayer to God that I don't want to be a Christian. Neither did I choose or want to be a Bible teacher or serve in a disciple making church of mainly Korean missionaries. Yet this was Jesus' sovereignty for me. He might have even said 'I will show him how much he must suffer for my name!' Yet this was God's amazing grace for me, to participate in the most valuable work of disciple making in this generation. 

Yesterday I walked in the park with Paul after the Saturday seminar. We talked of how difficult it is to raise disciples, to give the message and call of the cross to privileged, capable and proud students, who don't want to commit to anything much. But from this passage I learn this is God's work and God's initiative, it is he who chooses and calls. What matters is that I make myself available as his instrument. When I look at Ananias and Paul they were both clearly instruments of Jesus. To be an instrument, I have to deny what I want, I have to listen to Jesus wants, I need then to be obedient and courageous. Ananias must have been fearful of approaching Saul, but when he did God used him very preciously. I pray I may learn the commitment, courage and obedience of Ananias.   

In conclusion, God himself works for his world redemptive purpose. He calls people according to his sovereign plan and fulfils his mission. He called Saul now as an apostle for the gentiles. A calling from God is personal and sovereign. We are also called by God by his one-sided grace. We do not deserve this grace. May God help us to remember this grace and serve our campus mission with a humble, debtor's heart. May God help us to be used as his instrument to preach the gospel for university students (in the whole world).
