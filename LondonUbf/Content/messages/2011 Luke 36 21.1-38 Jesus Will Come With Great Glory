2011 Luke 36

JESUS WILL COME WITH GREAT GLORY

Luke 21:1-38
Key verse 21:27
�At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.�

The title of Today�s message is �Jesus will come with great glory�. Jesus taught the disciples various signs of the end of age.  And Jesus planted hope in their hearts that he will come on a cloud with great glory. May God help us to have firm faith and hope in Jesus� coming and have a clear Christian view on the history of the world.  

I.	The signs of the end of the age(1-24)

  Look at verses 1, 2. �As he looked up, Jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury. He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins.� Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their offerings into the temple treasury and saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins. I want to mention here about Jesus� looking. Because this whole chapter is in one sense about the way Jesus looks and sees and how the world tends to look on things. The way we look shapes our world view and has an impact on our daily lives. So, Jesus looks up and sees the rich making an offering and this poor widow putting in two small copper coins. How much is two small copper coins? According to scholars, two small copper coins is 1/64 of a denarius which is equivalent to 80 pence. How did Jesus see her offering? Look at verses 3 and 4.  ? tell you the truth,?he said, ?his poor widow has put in more than all the others. All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.� Amazingly Jesus said that she put in more than all the others. Why did Jesus say that she put more than all the others? It means all the others gave out of their wealth, so it did not cost them anything, it did not make an impact on their bank statements, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on. Probably she had to eat porridge every meal. If she did not have any, she would fast whole day. Two copper coins were nothing to the rich but for her, it was everything that she had to live on. Even so, She did not calculate but gave it to God sacrificially. Her offering was beyond what she could afford. It was devotional and sacrificial. Jesus looked up and he saw her passionate love toward God. So Jesus valued her offering the most and praised her.   

  Look at verse 5. �Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said,� Again this verse is about looking, how the disciples look and then how Jesus looks. They all come out of the temple and see these beautiful stones and they say, �Wow! Look at the massive magnificent stones.� The disciples who came from Galilee were amazed by all the things in Jerusalem. Among them, the Herod the Great�s temple. It was still being completed in marble. There were 19.7m high marble pillars. It is amazing how they could cut such big stones and move them. It is still a mystery to us that they could do this without modern technology. The east side of the temple had gold plate that reflected the rising sun. The inner part of the temple also shone with all kinds of jewels and gold. The disciples were amazed by the magnificence of the temple and they wanted Jesus to join them in their awe. 

  But how did Jesus respond? Look at verse 6. ?s for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down.� Jesus told them that all the marvelous stones, every one of them would be thrown down, not one would be left on another. The temple was one of the masterpieces of the age. It seemed its glory would last forever. But Jesus saw it would be destroyed without one stone left on another? The reason was saw that though outwardly beautiful and luxurious, inwardly it was utterly corrupted and rotten. Jesus saw no inner beauty nothing that would please God. Herod had made it to render glory to himself and the religious leaders, in their greed for money and power, had turned it into a den of robbers. They had lost their love and devotion to God but became habitual and ritualistic. Jesus knew that such a temple could not escape God�s judgment even if it was built with beautiful stones and decorated with gold. 

  So again, just as we have seen with the rich and the poor widow�s offering, we see how differently Jesus looks on things, how different his value system is, how differently he sees beauty and things of eternal value. The disciples were captured by external beauty. People are interested in outward appearances, intellectual ability, careers and family background. People envy those who have such things and pursue them. These days there is so much emphasis on exterior beauty, there are tanning shops, nail bars, beauty parlours, for men as well as women, as well as your usual hair salons and plastic surgery clinics. Just check out the prices for some moisturising cream in duty free! Then there are the gadgets, you I-phones and I �Pads, not to mention fashion, with the moist expensive brands. How much time do we as a culture and individually focus on external appearance? Under this atmosphere, Christians can be easily swayed by worldly value system and struggle to look after outward beauty rather than inner beauty. In Noah�s time, the sons of God were like that. They saw external beauty of women and married anyone they chose. When they established their family based on the beauty of the daughters of men, such families could not last and soon society became utterly corrupt. 

 In contrast, Jesus did not see the outward beauty but saw inner beauty. Though the widow offered two copper coins, Jesus saw her pure love and devotion to God. Though the temple was decorated with gold and beautiful stones, Jesus was angry seeing the corruption of the temple. He had a clear spiritual value system. Jesus did not want his disciples to be tempted by external beauty but to be spiritual men who could see inner beauty. Jesus didn�t want them tempted by the cravings of sinful men, the lust of the eyes and boasting in fleeting things. He wanted them to obey the will of God. 

 Look at verse 7.?eacher,  they asked, ?hen will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?� News that the temple would be destroyed was unthinkable for the disciples, something so permanent, so glorious, completely destroyed. It was tantamount to the end of the world itself. So they asked Jesus two things, when it would happen and what would be the signs. Jesus didn�t say anything about when, but what follows are the signs they should look out for.

First, watch out that you are not deceived (8)

Look at verse 8. He replied: ?atch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, �I am he,� and, �The time is near.� Do not follow them.� The first sign of the end of age is the appearance of false messiahs. As the end approaches, people become insecure about the future. These days we are facing the possibility of a double dip recession, Greece�s debt threatens to bring down the European economy, and there has been another rogue trader discovered at UBS. Young people cannot find jobs. To be an undergraduate student means taking on a debt of 30 -- 40, 000 GDP on graduation. The world has become so competitive. With all the uncertainty and anxiety people are vulnerable to false Messiahs promising a way out, even believers can be fooled. Therefore disciples need a clear spiritual value system and discernment based on a deep knowledge of the word of God. 

 So what is a false Messiah? It can be anything or anyone that points to a solution other than our real Messiah Jesus Christ. It can be money, the messiah of Mammon, which promises to solve every problem, whether by salary, or the lottery or most recently looting. People follow money gurus to make them rich, even in Christianity preachers can use wealth and prosperity rather than the gospel of Jesus to attract people. People run after the �perfect� boy friend or girl friend, false messiahs who promise sweet happiness but only break hearts further down the road. In the past there were the ideologies of Marxism and Fascism that captured people�s minds, these days there is a confidence in the new atheism that plants a materialistic and ultimately nihilistic and selfish personal philosophy. Yet, people still suffer from sexual corruption, high divorce rate and broken families. Such messiahs cannot save our lives nor gives us happiness. 

  There have been different attempts to trace the origin of Western spiritual corruption, we put it down to the Enlightenment, or industrialisation, or secular philosophy, the most recent of which are various brands of post- modernism etc. But in any generation, the problem  is the same, it comes from human sinful nature whose instinct is to avoid the cross of Jesus Christ. Simply, when people walk away from Jesus-- from his suffering, death and resurrection, from accepting Jesus as the way, the truth and the life--one walks into the arms of alternative false messiahs. People think they can find answers, meaning, purpose, happiness, love, freedom-- whatever they are looking for, by deserting the cross. It is only Jesus who gives eternal salvation, true freedom, light and happiness to those who believe in him. May God help us not to follow false messiahs in the world but to follow our true Messiah Jesus who can give us salvation, victory and eternal life. 

When a whole society or culture walks away from Jesus, it can seem so normal that nothing seems to be wrong. It is only when the fruit of following false messiahs becomes obvious that people start talking about �broken Britain� or other such slogans. Jesus knew that there would be many false messiahs at the end of age. For that reason he wanted his disciples to have a clear spiritual value system and helped them to see and look from God�s spiritual view point

Second, do not be frightened (9-11) 
Look at verses 9-11. �When you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away. Then he said to them: ?ation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven.?he second sign that Jesus talks about are wars and natural disasters. Such things have always happened but seem to be on the increase with greater frequency as in the pains of child birth. It�s terrifying and traumatic to experience such events but Jesus says do not be frightened. Rather such events should make us repentant and spiritually alert, that we understand nothing is stable or permanent and we can instead live by faith put our hope firmly in the new heaven and new earth
Third, this will result in your being witnesses to them. (12-15)
 Look at verses 12-15. ?ut before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name. This will result in your being witnesses to them. But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.� There would be a great persecution on those who believe and follow Jesus at the end of the age. They would persecute believers and deliver them to synagogues and prison and bring them before kings and governors. They suffering would be great on account of Jesus but would result in them bearing witnesses. It would be a chance to preach the gospel to the world. When disciples keep their faith despite dreadful persecution and trials, loss and pain, the gospel can be powerfully preached to non-believers so many could come to believe in Jesus. The history of Christianity is a history not of conquering by force but of witnessing through persecution, whether that be in ancient Rome or contemporary China.
Fourth, by standing firm you will gain life (16-19)
  Look at verses 16-19. �You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death. All men will hate you because of me. But not a hair of your head will perish. By standing firm you will gain life.� Jesus said that even closet family would betray believers, how painful and hurtful that would be. Jesus also said that all men will hate them because of him. But the world can�t destroy the faith of believers. They can kill their bodies but can�t destroy their love and faith. Therefore disciples should stand firm whatever is thrown at them. Then they will have salvation and the final victory. 
After telling the signs of the end of age Jesus then told them about the destruction of the Jerusalem. In verses 20-24 he warned them that when they saw Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, they would know that its desolation was near. Then they should flee to the mountains and get out of the city. There would be no mercy on pregnant women and nursing mothers.  There would be great distress in the land and wrath against the people. They would fall by the sword and be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem would be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles were fulfilled. This was fulfilled by Roman soldiers in AD 70. In those days people thought Jerusalem would remain forever. But when it became corrupted, even the Jerusalem was destroyed. The destruction of Jerusalem is the sign of the coming judgment of the world. 
II. The end of the age and the coming of the Son of Man (25-38)
  
After talking about the destruction of Jerusalem, Jesus now talks about the end of the age. Look at verses 25, 26. �There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. Men will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken.� But at that time, what glorious thing would happen? Look at verse 27.  �At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.� At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. When Jesus first came, he came as a baby in a manger and only received the welcome of magi and shepherds. But when Jesus comes again, everybody will see him coming on a cloud with power and great glory. Look at verse 28. �When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.� That day would be sorrow and despair to the world of unbelief but is the day of victory and salvation and glory to believers. Believers receive much suffering while struggling to keep their faith and preach the gospel. There are many times they cannot lift up their heads under persecution from the world and severe trials. But when these things begin to take place believers should stand up and lift up their heads knowing that their redemption is drawing near. When Jesus comes back, he will wipe all the tears of believers and lead them to the eternal kingdom of God. He will commend them saying, �Good and faithful servants!� He will grant them eternal life as a gift. Jesus who will come on a cloud with great power and glory is a true hope to believers who keep faith and take up cross. When we put our hope in Jesus� coming, we can receive power and grace despite all kinds of sufferings, persecution and pain. Thank and praise Jesus who will come with great power and glory and comfort us and lead us into the eternal kingdom of God. 
When will this all happen? In verses 29-33. Gives an analogy of a fig tree, that just as a fig tree sprouting anticipates summer so we can know Jesus is near when we see the signs he describes. This is not precise but the point is we stay alert. He says in verses 34-36. that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap. Therefore we should always watch, and pray to escape God�s wrath and stand before the Son of Man. At the beginning I asked the question what difference does it make to know all this? Sure, it made a difference to those who we able to flee to the mountains rather than be massacred by the Romans, and when Jesus finally comes again, as believers it will be good to see him. But it has been almost 2,000 years since Jesus ascended into heaven, and though we see evidence of the signs increasing like the pains of childbirth, there is no indication he will come in our life time, though he may. But in the meantime we have life to get on with. What difference does knowing that Jesus will come in clouds of glory ,make to Mary, or Paul or Daniel or any believer or non-believer? That is a valid question.
The answer is to do with where and how and with what attitude we look in our day today lives. Jesus� message is look spiritually, understand everything is going to pass away heaven and earth will pass away. Actually everyone knows this. Life is full of uncertainty, suffering, tragedy and disaster and then we die. False messiahs don�t work, and facing the reality makes people despair, become weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness and the anxieties of life. But Jesus also says ?y words will never pass away.  ? am coming on a cloud of glory,  Therefore look up, stand up and lift up your heads. Believers instead of anxiety, fear and hopelessness, instead of losing heart, becoming depressed or becoming captured by temporary appearances and waste their lives, can lift up their heads because they have the hope of Jesus in their hearts. Our world view, how we see things, how we understand the world has a huge impact on our lives now not just in the future. However difficult or fearful or burdened life gets, we can look up at Jesus knowing that the future is eternal and victorious.  
What kind of life did Jesus live, who taught the glorious coming of the Son of Man? Look at verses 37, 38. Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives. Although Jesus was facing the death on the cross, Jesus made every effort to teach them about the things that would happen at the end of age and plant hope in them. And at night he took a rest praying on the Mount of Olives. And all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple. 

  Today we learn the Christian�s view on history. The history of humanity flows toward the day of the coming of Christ. That day will be the day of sorrow and despair to unbelievers but the day of salvation and victory and glory to believers. We should cherish this Christian view of history and overcome the temptation to fear and triumph kinds of trials and sufferings. We must be spiritually alert and be able to stand before Jesus when he comes with great power and glory. We must make every effort to teach the word of God and preach the gospel.
