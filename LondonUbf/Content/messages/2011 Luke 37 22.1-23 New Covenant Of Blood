NEW COVENANT OF BLOOD

Luke 22:1-23
Key verse 22:20
�In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, �This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.��

Last night we heard Jonathan�s message about power and strength. We all need power to do God�s work but the question Jonathan asked was how do we get it? The answer is Jesus� love and in today�s passage we see Jesus demonstrating his love for us by breaking bread and pouring out wine as a symbol of the sacrifice he was about to make on the cross. Today�s passage describes the new covenant between God and man. Jesus is showing us the greatest act of love the world has ever seen. I pray that through today�s message we would understand how much Jesus loves us and the grace he has given us through the new covenant. I pray that we would give thanks that Jesus gave his life to save us and put all our faith in him.
Look at verse 1; �Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching.� It was the time of the Passover when the Jews remembered God rescuing them from slavery in Egypt. The Jews were a slave nation; unlovable and ungrateful and yet God saved them through the slaughtering of a lamb. Jerusalem was full of people preparing to mark this great festival. This was a great opportunity for the religious leaders to pastor to the needs of their people. But verse two says; �and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.� The priests were not interested in service but power. They wanted to maintain power over the people through law but Jesus had power because he loved the people. Therefore the people had turned to Jesus and the priests were afraid of the people and wanted to get rid of Jesus. 
Jesus� popularity meant the priests were finding it hard to find a way to get rid of Jesus. Maybe they were considering kidnapping him or pretending he had had an accident but they could never seem to get him away from the crowds. Suddenly their problem was solved when to their amazement one of Jesus� 12 apostles came and offered to betray him. Look at verses 3 to 6; �Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. They were delighted and agreed to give him money. He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.� 
When we think that Jesus had called Judas and that Judas had just spent three years living with Jesus it seems incredible that one of Jesus� closest friends could now betray him. So we ask how this could happen. Verse 3 tells us that Satan entered Judas. But this poses a question. People often ask; �If Satan entered Judas, was Judas really responsible for his actions?� The answer is yes. Temptation comes from Satan and we are powerless to prevent it. However there is a difference between temptation which is the opportunity to sin and sin which is choosing to give in to temptation. Our responsibility is to resist temptation when it comes and prevent it becoming sin. This is difficult because Satan; ��prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.� This is what had happened to Judas. The temptation to sin had been with Judas for a long time and he had already given in to Satan.  John tells us that Judas was a thief and that he was upset about the perfume which the woman had poured over Jesus. Judas was already angry with Jesus and Satan took advantage of this to tempt Judas further. Because of his anger and his greed for money Judas gave in to temptation and sold Jesus to the priests.  
Our hearts are a battle ground between God and Satan. Therefore Proverbs (4:23) tells us; �Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life,� whilst James tells us; �Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.� Our hearts cannot simultaneously be filled with the love of God and a love for Satan. Therefore the key to resisting temptation is in filling our hearts with the love of God. When we do this Satan cannot enter. We maintain our relationship with God through prayer and meditation on God�s word and thus grow in the love of God and resist and overcome temptation. Judas lived with God for three years he had not allowed Jesus into his heart. Instead greed meant that his heart was open to Satan and Satan used him to betray Jesus. 
The second thing we need to know is how to overcome sin when we do fall. We know that we will all sin but repentance means we can come back to God and be forgiven. Like Judas Peter also betrayed Jesus yet Peter repented. When the cock crowed three times Peter wept because he realised what he had done to his friend. Peter had a relationship with Jesus, Peter loved Jesus. He was an impulsive man who often made mistakes but he was not too proud to confess his sin. For this reason Peter became free of his sin. Through prayer, the word of God and repentance let us keep our hearts filled with love for Jesus, then Satan cannot enter us and lead us into sin.
Look at verse 8; �Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.� Everyone in Jerusalem was preparing to sacrifice the Passover lamb and Jesus and the apostles were no different. So Jesus sent Peter and John to make preparations. He knew that there was a room prepared and he told them that they would meet a man carrying a water jar who would lead them to the house where they were going to eat. This detail reminds us again that Jesus knew exactly what was going to happen throughout his passion. There is no element which happened by accident and no time at which Jesus was surprised. Through this Jesus tells us again that he chose to go to the cross and die for us because he loves us. 
Look at verses 13 and 14; �When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. And he said to them, I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.� The city probably had more than a million people in it. Jesus had spent the week teaching the crowds but now he wanted to be alone with his twelve apostles. Verse 14 even tells us that he was eager to eat this meal. He was eager because this was the last meal he would eat with the twelve; he wanted to teach them the fundamental truth about why he had come into the world and introduce to them the new covenat. He was eager to fulfil the mission for which he was sent; Jesus had to go to the cross and die in order to save the world. We cannot imagine anyone being eager to go to the cross. Over the next couple of weeks we will study Jesus� arrest, torture and crucifixion. In the Garden of Gethsemane he would sweat blood. Yet Jesus is eager to eat this meal because he knows that he is ushering in the new covenant. Jesus loves us, he came to this world to bring salvation. Therefore he was eager to eat this meal because it would explain the new covenant and reveal how people could be saved and enter the kingdom of God.
Look at verse 16; �For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God.� At this moment and until after the resurrection Jesus was the only one who would understand what was happening. Although he had told the apostles many times and here he would illustrate it to them using bread and wine, they would not understand. But verse 16 tells us that Jesus would eat the Passover meal again when it found fulfilment in the Kingdom of God. The Bible often talks of the kingdom of God as a feast. The Passover meal is a rehearsal for the eternal feast we will enjoy with Jesus. In the kingdom of God the true meaning of the Passover will be apparent. The feast will celebrate the salvation of mankind by our Passover lamb Jesus who was crucified to save us from our sin and death. 
Luke does not describe for us the eating of the meal itself. There would have been a roast lamb with bitter herbs and all the other ingredients described in Exodus. The Passover meal is a ritual which every Jewish family then and now would eat in exactly the same way every year to remember their freedom from Egypt. This would have been a delicious meal celebrated in exactly the right way but Luke focuses on two things which were not part of the normal Passover; the cup of wine and the breaking of bread. Look at verses 19 and 20; �And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me. In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying; �This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.� 
This would have seemed mysterious to the disciples and Luke records nothing they said about it. Yet it is one of the most important moments in the Bible because it is here that Jesus describes the new covenant. For over 1400 years the Jews had been living under the old covenant based the 10 commandments. God said to the Israelites through Moses that they must keep his decrees and obey him and in return God would ensure that things would go well with them. This is a covenant built on obedience to the law. Ultimately we see that this covenant failed because the Israelites were unable to obey God�s law. This is true of all mankind because �all are sinners� therefore this covenant based on law could never be successful in saving us from sin. 
The new covenant is different though. Verses 19 and 20 show us that this covenant is based on Jesus offering his body and blood as a sacrifice for our sin. In verse 19 Luke describes Jesus tearing the bread, just as his body would be torn on the cross the following day. Then he said; �do this in remembrance of me� because Jesus wants us to remember the sacrifice he made for us. In verse 20 Jesus says; �this is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.� The following day Jesus� blood would pour out of his wounds as he became the Passover lamb who died for all people. Man�s greatest problem is sin. Sin separates us from God and sin can only be overcome through blood. At the first Passover the blood of a lamb was put on people�s doors to save them. Then God established the sacrificial system so that people could make atonement for their sin. Now Jesus would give his blood to save all mankind from sin and death. There would be no more sacrifices after this. 
Jesus gave everything for us on the cross. What does he ask us to do in return? He just asks us to remember. This is the new covenant, it so different to the old covenant. The old covenant was all about obedience to the law; the new one is all about a loving relationship with Jesus who fulfils the law for us. In this we can see the priests� problem, they stuck to the law without any love for people and the people turned from them. We can also see Judas� problem, he did not have a relationship with Jesus. 
Ever since Jesus was crucified Christians have remembered his sacrifice by breaking bread and pouring out wine. Even when people could not read the Bible they could understand what Jesus had done through this. When I was growing up I received communion every week but I did not really understand what it was about. The reason was that I did not accept my sinfulness and therefore could not understand why Jesus would have to die for me. But now as I come to see my sin and Jesus� perfect love the more I understand how great this sacrifice is. What the breaking of bread and pouring out of wine reminds us is that when we were beyond salvation in our sin, Jesus� sacrifice was the only thing which could save us. Therefore when Jesus says do this in remembrance of me he means remember that he died on the cross to save us when we could not save ourselves. He is saying to us remember how much I love you. Jesus wants us to remember his love and his sacrifice and our freedom from sin by doing this in remembrance of him. Paul says �For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord�s death until he comes� (1 Cor 11:23-36). It might seem to some people a bit depressing to remember someone�s death but when we remember Jesus� sacrifice we are remembering his great victory over sin and death. I pray that each of us would meditate on this great victory, grow in our gratitude to Jesus, our love for Jesus and share with others our love for Jesus. 
This is a great passage for us to consider the day before the new term starts. Today we can remember with gratitude the great sacrifice Jesus made for us on the cross. Tomorrow we can go out and proclaim this great news to others so that they also may be saved and experience the love of Jesus in their lives. When we talk to students this term we can focus on this simple truth; Jesus died to save us because he loves us. We did nothing and we do not need to do anything to earn his love. Therefore the Christianity we preach is not a set of rules that people need to follow. The point of our Christian life is to know and grow in the love of Jesus. We do this through reading the Bible, meditating on the word of God, praying, attending the Sunday service and sharing the Gospel with other people. None of this is to earn Jesus� love, through this supper he shows how much he already loves us. Instead all of this is to better understand Jesus� love and to share the great news of salvation with other people. What a great, refreshing message to bring to students at the beginning of term; there is nothing you can do to win your salvation, just believe in Jesus who died for you because he loves you. 
Look at verses 21 and 22; �But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him.� Finally Jesus told his apostles that one of them would betray him. He wanted them to know that what was about to happen was not an accident and that like everything he knew and had decided to take the cross. Verse 23 tells us that; �They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.� The apostles said nothing about the bread and wine because they did not understand but they understood what betrayal meant. They were horrified that one of them would betray Jesus after they had spent three years together. Had they known it was Judas he probably would not have left the room alive. They certainly would have tried to protect their leader. Yet Jesus did not tell them because he still loved Judas and was giving him a final opportunity to repent. This is how much he loves each one of us. We are sinners, we betray him, yet what did he do? Because he loves us Jesus chose to die on the cross and give his body and blood to save us from sin and death. 
In conclusion. The bread and wine of the last supper is an illustration of the new covenant. Through it Jesus shows us how much he loves us. Jesus died for us and has already won new life for us. Jesus is the only one we should put our faith in. As we enter the new term let�s remember what Jesus has done for us and put all our faith in him. Amen
