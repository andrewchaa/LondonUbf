SEND OUT WORKERS INTO THE HARVEST FIELD


Luke 9:51-10:24
Key verse: Luke 10:2
He told them, �The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.�

In today�s message Jesus appointed seventy two disciples and sent them out with the prayer topic �Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field.� Through this prayer we see both Jesus� love for lost sinners and his burning desire to find and call workers for harvest. May this prayer come into our hearts and work in our lives. May God help us to see what is most important to Jesus and share his heart to go to the harvest field of UCL.

1.	Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.

Look at verse 51. �As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.� The time for Jesus to be taken up to the heaven was approaching. Very soon his life on the earth would be over, he would be betrayed, rejected by his own people, flogged, mocked and hung up to die. Jesus knew how his life would end and he knew how much he would suffer, yet here we see him resolutely heading towards Jerusalem. He resolutely decided to take his cross. He was not dragged to the cross, but willingly proceeded to take it. 

Jesus shows us here the way that we should take up our crosses. When we try to take up the cross without a resolute attitude, it becomes a heavy burden. Though we take it up, we are likely to put it back down again somewhere along the way. In this kind of life there is no joy, no power, no victory, and no fruit. We become tired and powerless. On the other hand, when one takes the cross with a resolute attitude we can carry it to the end, we do not give up but our lives become victorious. How can we take it up with such an attitude? Verse 51 does not talk about the cross, rather it talks about Jesus being taken up to heaven. Jesus could take the cross when he looked beyond the cross to the victory, victory over sin and death and the glory of the kingdom of heaven. Last week at Ashburnham we saw a glimpse of the kingdom through Revelation 21-22. When we look towards heaven, and look forward to the final victory we can take up our cross with a resolute attitude. If any of us are feeling burdened by our crosses let�s deeply meditate on God�s kingdom and take them up with a new resolute attitude.

Look at verse 52. �And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him.� Jesus� coming to this village was a wonderful chance for the Samaritans to hear the word of God and receive blessings and grace from Jesus. Yet, the People did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem. (53) Because of prejudice towards the Jews they were ready to cut themselves off from salvation. James and John�s pride was so wounded by the rejection that they said, �Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?� Jesus was going to Jerusalem to die for the sin of the world. He was about to take all the fire from heaven upon himself so that others could be saved. So Jesus rebuked the disciples and moved on. The son of man did not come to destroy men�s lives but to save them. Anger, pride and division can never be justified. If we find these things in our heart we must repent.

2. The cost of discipleship. (57-62)

In the next few verses Luke describes three conversations with three unidentified people. In Matthews gospel he tells us who the first two are, but here Luke wants us to concentrate on the content of the conversation rather than who said it. They are three separate conversations yet he puts them side by side because they are all pressing towards the same issue - the cost of discipleship. 

Look at verse 57 �As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, �I will follow you wherever you go.� What an amazing man this was! Can you imagine walking into UCL and a student walking up to you and saying �I want to grow as a disciple of Jesus, please teach me the Bible!� Probably we would either faint in shock or start doing cartwheels in the quad. This guy was such a precious candidate for a disciple. Yet, what did Jesus say to him? �Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.� (58) What is Jesus doing here, is he trying to discourage a man from becoming a disciple? Not at all, but he wants the man to be clear about what he is getting himself involved in. He is saying �Following me will not mean comfort, ease, and wealth. That is not the way that I am going myself. If you are going to follow you will suffer, this is a life of hardships and warfare.� Jesus knows the hearts of this man and is identifying a spiritual struggle that he will have and he�s asking him to count the costs. Jesus is saying �Are you sure? Do you know what you�re getting yourself into? Do you realize what this is going to mean for you?� Jesus is not ready simply to accept the momentary expression of a person�s desire to follow him and then see him quit when the going gets tough, how discouraging that will be for others! Discipleship is for life, it is not an easy life but it is the most fulfilling.

When we follow Jesus, very often the situations we find ourselves in are not as we had expected and prayed for. We can face failure, rather than a victory. Sufferings and hardships, rather than a blessing. Sometimes we serve the ministry unnoticed while others receive complements and praise. Financial problems, housing difficulties, suffering and adversity come, even though we follow Jesus. Jesus wanted this man to be clear and he also wants us to be clear. We are so easily discouraged when difficulties and hardships come, we think that something is wrong and we need to change the way that we are doing things. But, Jesus says �the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.� �I suffered and if you are following me, so will you.� Suffering is as much part of the life of faith as joy and peace. Yet our suffering is never in vein, through our sufferings we come to learn Jesus. Through our sufferings we grow to become like him.
 
Look at verse 59 and 60. He said to another man, �Follow me.� But the man replied, �Lord, first let me go and bury my father.� Jesus said to him, �Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.� What on earth is more important to a man than burying his own father: It is the most essential thing for all of us to do as a son or a daughter. It does not take too long to dig a 6 foot hole and put someone into it. And yet, Jesus said, �Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.� What does this mean? This means that proclaiming the kingdom of God is the most important thing in this world, even more than burying one�s father. It should never be compromised by anything, but given absolute priority. Saving the lives of those who are destined to eternal destruction is the most vital work we can do in our lifetime. 

Look at verse 61 and 62. Still another said, �I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family.� Jesus replied, �No one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.� This man says �I will follow you.� But there is one condition, which is to go back and to say goodbye to his family. This is very similar to the calling of Elisha in 1 Kings chapter 19. Elijah went to call Elisha to follow him, become his disciple and eventually take his job. Elisha was ploughing at that moment and after Elijah called him Elisha said �Okay Elijah, I�ll follow you, but first let me go kiss my father and my mother goodbye.� And Elijah says to him what? �Fine. No problem. Go do it. Perfectly reasonable request. Go kiss mum and dad goodbye.�

But to this disciple Jesus is saying, �Don�t even go tell your parents goodbye� Why? There are two reasons. Firstly, when we look back we go off course. A plough should go in a straight line, in order for that to happen one needs to always look forward if not we go off course. When Jesus calls us he wants us to press on in the new life with him, if we keep looking back at our old life, romanticising about the past we will lose power, and our spiritual direction. Secondly, Jesus is saying �I�m more important. I am God in the flesh. I am the Messiah. I am the Saviour.� �While it was perfectly appropriate for Elisha to go back and say goodbye to his parents, I�m someone greater than Elijah.� Jesus is saying, �I�m worth it. I�m greater than Elijah. I�m greater than anything you can give up. I�m greater than worldly wealth or comfort, greater than your mother or your father. I�m greater than anything in life, everything in life that you treasure the most. I�m worth it all.� When we have Jesus as our treasure we have his joy, his peace, his life, his vision and hope. We have everything! When we truly have Jesus in our hearts, when he is our treasure we can give up anything in this world. 

3. Ask the Lord to send out workers into his harvest field. (10:1-24)

Look at verse 1. �After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.� Jesus was desperate to preach the kingdom of heaven and to save as many souls as possible, so, he sent out 72 ill equipped and relatively untrained men to preach the message. What kind of prayer topics did he give to those whom he sent? Look at verse 2. �He told them, �The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.� Many of us here have been doing out reach for a number of years, each of us have faced rejection, we have also served students for a while and seen them walk away. With a climate of spiritual lethargy and New Atheism on the rise the harvest field looks like a baron place. Yet, how did Jesus see it? He said, �The harvest is plentiful.� In Jesus� eyes this world is full of lost souls who have a hunger for restoration; who yearn to come out of the darkness, meet Jesus and be transformed. There are many people who really want to know God�s hope for their lives and become Jesus� disciples. So what is the problem? Why can�t we find them? Is it the growth of New Atheism? No, Jesus says it is because the workers are few. 

We become convinced that the problem is the spiritual climate of our day but Jesus says that it is the physical number of workers that is the problem. If we increase the number of workers, we raise the odds and, the lost will be found and saved. I was thinking about this and, being a worker myself, I came to question how often I physically go to UCL campus, our harvest field. Currently it is once a week on a Saturday morning for roughly 50 minutes. When I am there I would say that I speak to, on average, 3-4 people. Now, after a little mathematics, taking into account summer/Christmas holidays and conference weekends, I worked out that over a one year period I will spend roughly 30 hours at UCL and speak to about 110 students. considdering there are 8760 hours in a year and roughly 23�000 students I am not really scratching the surface. I don�t need to wonder for too long why I don�t find someone to study the Bible with, the answer is clear. We can all ask our self this question and all do the math. Jesus wants to increase the number of workers and he wants us to sincerely pray for this. Yet our numbers are limited, so what can we do? If we double the amount of time that we spend on campus each week we will effectively double the size of our outreach ministry and double the number people who have the chance to be saved. This is something that I can personally, practically do. 

Also Jesus does want us to pray in order to solve this problem? He told his disciples to ask God. �Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field.� The Lord of the harvest is God. He is the one who chooses, appoints, and sends out the workers. No one can go out to the field without his will or approval. Therefore, we must plead with God, the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into the harvest field. This is Jesus� heat, his heart is broken because the lost, dying souls, and this should also be our heart, our burning desire to save as many souls as possible. Are we praying this prayer? Do we cry out that God may raise up house churches to pioneer the 100 universities in the UK? Jesus urges us, actually he commands us to share this prayer topic with him. The Harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Let�s ask God to raise up workers and be those workers. 

Even though the disciples were weak, Jesus wanted them to go out with faith and to get trained to become powerful workers of the gospel. How did Jesus train his disciples?
First, They must rely only on God alone. Look at verse 4a. �Do not take a purse or bag or sandals.� The seventy two disciples were not as mature in spirit as the twelve disciples. So it seems quite reasonable to send them out with something such as bag, sandals, or purse with money. However, Jesus gave them the command to have faith only in God; relying only on God, not anything else. Even weak people can be clothed with the power from heaven and become great soldiers of faith. 
Second, Jesus told them not to be distracted from their mission. (4b) Jesus told them not to greet anyone on the road. When we set out on our mission Satan does his best to distract us, suddenly a friend will call, the children will need help, or the bathroom will suddenly need redecorating. When we allow these things to distract us we lose focus and become ineffective. Like Jesus we need to be resolute when we set out for mission. 
Third, � stay in one house� serve the person that God gives to you. Serving one man well is more effective than serving many half heartedly (5-8). 
Fourth, Look at verse 9. �Heal the sick who are there and tell them, �The kingdom of God is near you.� Healing was a precursor to their preaching, when the people saw healing they would know that God was with them and listen to the message. Our lives should be the precursor to our preaching, people should see through the way that we live that God is with us, then they will listen to our message.
Fifth, Be realistic. (10-12) Jesus says that some towns will not welcome them. We should not be disappointed or angry when people reject us, it will happen, we must simply warn them clearly that the kingdom of God is near 
Sixth, realise the weight of your message. (13-16) Jesus taught his disciples that stern judgment would be waiting for those who do not repent at the gospel his disciples would be preaching. Then he said, �He who listens to you listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.�(16) The way that people respond to our message has eternal consequences, when they reject us they are rejecting the only true God and salvation. The gospel is the most important message that a person will hear in their lives. It is a spiritual battle to plant the gospel. We must not take outreach lightly but see it as a matter of either giving people life or for them to reject it and face eternal death,
 
 Look at verse 17. �The seventy-two returned with joy and said, �Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.� They were so happy and proud of the success of their mission. Jesus encouraged them saying, �I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.� Their mission had looked tough, Jesus had said they were like lambs among wolves, yet, when they went forward with faith and obedience Jesus could work through them and give them victory.

Look at verse 20. �However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.� Gaining our happiness from works is dangerous we either become proud, when things go well or gloomy when they don�t. This kind of happiness is temporary and unstable. But, the fact that our names are written in heaven is eternal and glorious. Thus, this should be the source of our joy. 

What else made Jesus happy? Look at verse 21 �full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, �I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.� This is one of the only times we see Jesus break into spontaneous praise. God had revealed the kingdom of God to the disciples and they in turn had lead others to salvation and the kingdom. What we see here is that if we want to fill Jesus with Joy then we should reveal the kingdom to others. Jesus is most happy when his workers go into the harvest field and preach the gospel. 

In this passage we learned Jesus� burning desire to save all people. Jesus sent out seventy-two untrained disciples to proclaim the kingdom of God. When they obeyed Jesus both they and Jesus were overjoyed. Let�s pray that the Lord may send out workers to UCL and to 100 universities in the UK. Let�s go to UCL proclaiming, �The kingdom of God is near.�
