2010 Acts 5

Tell the people the full message of this new life

Acts 4:32-5:42 
Key Verse 5:20
"Go, stand in the temple courts," he said, "and tell the people the full message of this new life." 

The early church grew through persecution from the very beginning. We can see this throughout Acts, but particularly from Chapter 4-7. This persecution at this time was mainly from Jews. In this Chapter we see how the Sanhedrin persecutes the early believers. They felt threatened by the apostles and tried their best to stop them spreading the gospel. However, the more they were persecuted, the more the early church grew and the wider the gospel spread. May God help us to realise that we are in a spiritual battle and that we grow as courageous gospel workers. May God renew our sense of mission through this message.
 
Verses 32-37 show several different aspects of the early church. Look at verse 32. 'All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had.' In those days, the number of believers was several thousand. They had come to faith through Peter's preaching (2:41,4:3). They had received much grace through the work of Holy Spirit through the word of God. As a result of this, all became one in heart and spirit. They all shared their belongings. In other words, they did not insist that things belonged to them. Rather, they made their possessions available to the community voluntarily. They could do so because they realised God's grace was on each of them. As a result, the early church could become a loving and spiritual community. Then, what was the core message which the apostles preached? Look at verse 33. 'With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all.' The apostles preached the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. They preached Jesus, whom the Jews had crucified, was raised from the dead. The apostles preached this message of the resurrection with great power, with boldness and confidence by the help of Holy Spirit. A great number of people received grace through this message. In the past, they had lived hopeless and helpless lives under Roman occupation. They could not live beyond their day-to-day survival. Yet, they totally changed after hearing the message of Jesus' death and resurrection. When they had resurrection faith, they could overcome their greed for money. With the hope of resurrection, they could willingly give their possessions to those who were in need. Perhaps, they had initially helped people at an individual level. Then, later when things grew, they brought the money to the apostles. The early believers' sharing is different from a communist model in that they didn't do this out of obligation, but with a willing heart. We can see whether one has real resurrection faith or not by their use of money. Those who have true hope in the resurrection give generously to God and their neighbours in need. 

Verse 36 talks about Barnabas. He was a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement). He sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet. He was a man of heart. He overcame Jewish prejudice towards the gospel and was used preciously in the redemptive work along with Paul. Yet, when there is a great work of God, there is also the work of Satan. Look at verse 5:1-2. 'Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. With his wife's full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles' feet. The name Ananias means 'the grace of God.' Saphira is from the jewel Saphire and means 'beautiful.' They should have lived up to their names. Yet, when they heard Barnabas' was being praised by the Apostles, they also wanted to be praised. So, they sold their property. However, they could not overcome their desire for money. This couple conspired together to put only a part of what they received at the apostles' feet. Ananias lied to the apostles, saying that this was all they had gained. Peter could detect Ananias' lie. So, he rebuked him. "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God.' 

Ananias' problem was not in bringing only a little money, but in lying to the Holy Spirit. How could this be? It was because Peter at that time was the leader of early church and so, deceiving him was the same as deceiving the Holy Spirit. Peter didn't take this problem lightly. Instead, he saw it as the work of Satan. If this problem was not properly dealt with, they would have been praised like Barnabas even though they were in fact liars and hypocrites. This would have corrupted the church and mean that the Holy Spirit couldn't work through the community any longer. Inner problems like this are more serious and damaging than outer attacks. Peter severely rebuked Ananias. After listening to Peter's rebuke, Ananias immediately died. Young believers had to carry out his body to bury him. About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. Peter asked her, "Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?" Peter asked this question to help her to repent. Yet, Saphira also stupidly lied to the Holy Spirit, instead of repenting her sins. Peter rebuked her and she also died immediately. 
 
Outer persecution is easy to detect and we can fight it together in one spirit. Yet, inner attacks are harder to detect and it is impossible for us to fight against them with our human wisdom and strength. Peter spiritually alert and detected this inner attack and protected the church. Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events. People who were also a bit like Ananias and Saphira repented and decided to dedicate themselves to the work of the Holy Spirit with a pure heart. After this event, the great work of the Holy Spirit continued even more powerfully.
 
The event of Ananias and Saphira gives us an important lesson. In the history, churches which kept their purity and holiness were used in the redemptive work as living churches. Yet, those which compromised with the world, without removing the yeast-problem like this gradually fall apart. The yeast-problem in the church therefore must be clearly dealt with. We need to grow as a community that the Holy Spirit can work in and use. We can deceive men's eyes, but not God's eyes. When we live before the eyes of people, not before God, we can easily commit the sin of Ananias. We become hypocritical and lie to the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we must struggle to be far from hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is the same with unbelief. Those who live before God have a stable faith and they are not influenced by what other people think of them. They don't care whether people praise them or criticise them. Instead, they have peace even when persecuted or misunderstood, because they know that God sees everything. These people have inner freedom and grow continually. As a result, they will be used very preciously in God's work. Those who live with a casual heart before God, with desire to be praised by people must realise this is vanity. May God help us to find ourselves before the word of God and serve God alone with pure heart.  May God help us to live an honest life free of hypocrisy, and without the desire for honour or popularity. 

Verses 12-16 talks about the miracles and wonders which the apostles performed. When the yeast was removed and the purity of the church was maintained, the work of God grew more powerfully. Look at verses 12-13.The apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon's Colonnade. No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people. The apostles' spiritual authority grew all the more through the miracles and wonders they performed. People brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. At this time when the church grew powerfully, conflict with Jewish religious leaders arose again. Look at verses 17-18. 'Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy. They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.' Because, it was evening, they jailed them until the morning when the Sanhedrin opened. The arrest of Peter and all the apostles was a big blow to the early church. Without them, the church was in the danger of collapse. What did God do      at this time? Look at verse 19. 'But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out.'

God sent his angel to free them. This reminds us of Jesus' death and resurrection. Enemies crucified Jesus, yet God raised him from the dead on the 3rd day. The work of God can't be frustrated by men. What did God say to them through the angel? Look at verse 20. "Go, stand in the temple courts," he said, "and tell the people the full message of this new life." The angel did not say to them run away to a safer place. He did not advise them to hide away for a while. Instead, he said to them to go to the temple, where the religious leaders are. What did he then say them to do? 'and tell the people the full message of this new life.' Here, the message of this new life means the message of the resurrection and the message which brings us new life. God commanded the apostles to tell this full message of new life in the temple court, even if it meant risking their lives. Physical life is not everything. There is also spiritual life. Often, people become nihilistic when they think of their sudden death. They lose power, motivation and meaning of life. This is true. Even if we gain the whole world, what good is it if we suddenly die? The bible clearly says that our life in this world is short, but our spiritual life is eternal. Our soul was dead because of our sins. Yet, we received new life through the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. There is no other way to receive this new life than through the resurrection. The only way is to listen and believe the gospel. 

Today we live in a flood of knowledge. Yet, only the word of God can bring us knowledge of eternal life. Worldly knowledge makes us weary and proud. Yet, the word of God heals, revives and saves our soul from eternal destruction. Why do we invite people to bible study? It's to give them this new life ' eternal life through the word of life. It is up to us as gospel workers whether the numerous students receive or do not receive this new life. We therefore need to tell the full message of this new life. If we do our best, and they still do not accept that's their responsibilit. Yet, if they are destroyed because they had never heard the message of this new life, we are responsible for their destruction (Ezekiel 3:17-21)

In this midst of persecution, God commands the disciples to go to the temple and publicly preach the full message. He asked them to 'stand' and tell the 'full' message, not only the message of the cross but the message of the resurrection, which the Sadducees hate most. In other words, this means that they need to preach with a challenging spirit. Why should they do so? It is because we are in a spiritual battle. And we need to be spiritual fighters. Life saving work is like a spiritual battle. The work of God is the work of preaching. This 1:1 bible study ministry is also a spiritual battle. May God help us also to go to the university ' which is our temple court ' and tell the full message of this new life.

Look at verse 21. 'At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people. The apostles did not go home after being released from jail. They went straight to the temple court. They knew that they were at high risk to be jailed again. Yet, they preached the gospel to the people. When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin'the full assembly of the elders of Israel'and sent to the jail for the apostles. Yet, on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. Then someone came and said, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people." At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them. 

In verse 28, the high priest questioned the apostles again. Look at verse 28. "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said. "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood. He accused the disciples of the following two things. First, that they preached the name of Jesus ' violating what Sanhedrin had commanded them not to do. What did the apostles say to this? Look at verse 29. 'Peter and the other apostles replied: "We must obey God rather than men!' Jesus says, 'But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." God also said through the angel to tell the full message. Therefore, they should obey God rather than men. They should fear God, not the Sanhedrin. Second, the high priest accused the disciples of being determined to make them guilty of Jesus' blood. As for this charge, Peter and other disciples fearlessly testified to their sin of killing Jesus. 'The God of our fathers raised Jesus from the dead'whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree. God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Saviour that he might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel. We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him." The religious leaders should have acknowledged their sins and repented at this point. They should have asked God's forgiveness. 

Yet, instead how did they react? Look at verse 33. They became furious and wanted to kill them. But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honoured by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while. He persuaded the Sanhedrin to leave them alone, because if their purpose or activity was of human origin, it would fail. But if it was from God, they would not be able to stop the apostles but would only find themselves fighting against God. The Sanhedrin accepted what Gamaliel said. They however called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.

In those days, the whip was made with three strips of leather. Often, people were flogged 39 times. Deut25:3, 2 Corin 1:24). It is very painful. Skin would be torn sometimes even to the bone. Yet, how were the apostles? Look at verse 41. 'The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.' The apostles were so happy for the privilege of participating in Jesus' suffering. They were the spiritual fighters and true witnesses of Jesus. Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ. They told the full message of the new life. Through this, the Jerusalem church became consolidated and the number of believers increased.

In conclusion, preaching the gospel is the most urgent and important task. God commands us with broken shepherd heart ' Tell the full message of this new life to all people. The life and death of people is up to those who preach the gospel. May God help us to have a very clear sense of responsibility and preach the full message of this new life with all our heart!
