2011 Luke 8

WHOM HE ALSO DESIGNATED APOSTLES

Luke 6:1-19
Key Verse 6:13
When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles

If we remember last week Jesus really begins to come up against the Pharisees. They were the religious leaders, yet they criticized Jesus for calling Levi and celebrating his new life direction. They were like old wine skins who couldn�t see their own sin and refused to repent. In this passage, their legalism and opposition becomes even more extreme. In such a time, what could Jesus do? He prayed all night and called the twelve as apostles. May God help us to meditate on Jesus� wisdom, love and hope in raising his apostles in a hopeless generation. 

I. Jesus healed a man with a shriveled hand on the Sabbath (6:1-11)
  
Look at verses 1-2. �One Sabbath Jesus was going through the cornfields, and his disciples began to pick some ears of corn, rub them in their hands and eat the grain. Some of the Pharisees asked, �Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?� It can�t have been easy to have been Jesus� disciples, particularly on the Sabbath. Remember we had a glimpse into �a day in the life of Jesus� at the end of Chapter 4 when he preached and drove out a demon, then healed Simon�s mother in law and then went into the night serving all the sick, laying his hands on each one. It was probably quite difficult to get three regular meals on such a day. Here we see the disciples were snatching a quick snack, which was permitted according to the law. (Dt 23:25) Yet here the Pharisees interpreted the disciples actions as unlawful on the Sabbath. The issue for them was the disciples were picking the corn on the Sabbath which as far as they were concerned qualified as work and therefore broke the fourth commandment, which says on the Sabbath, �On it you shall not do any work� (Ex 20:10). By this time in Israel�s history the Pharisees had developed a huge amount of extra rules about the Sabbath which were part of the oral tradition of the Torah, and not actually scripture. There 39 definitions of what constituted work. According to these rules, the disciples could be seen to be harvesting, winnowing and preparing food. 

We can think about the disciples at this moment. They were simple men who had just been caught out by the Pharisees who were acting like religious police. They must have felt embarrassed and intimidated. Yet Jesus defended them, and did so simply reading directly from Scripture. Look at verses 3-4. �Jesus answered them, �Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.� Jesus defended his disciples by telling them the story of David. He was a man after God�s own heart. In 1 Samuel 21, David while running away from Saul, went to the house of God and ate the consecrated bread and gave it to his companions. That bread was only lawful for the priest to eat. He violated the law, yet he was not condemned. It is because his action was motivated by his love and compassion for his men. The spirit of the law lies in compassion and love. It lies in loving and reviving souls with compassion and mercy. Jesus wanted the Pharisees to learn the spirit of the law, rather than the letter of the law. In following Jesus, the disciples were following God�s heart and were not guilty.
Jesus concluded in verse 5, �The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.� Here Jesus for the second time in Luke�s gospel refers to himself as the Son of man, a Messianic term taken from Daniel (7:13,14) in which the Son of man receives all authority, glory and power. Jesus established his authority as Almighty God, the one who originally made, and gave the Sabbath to people. Jesus is the central figure of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is not about following lots of rules and regulations but making Jesus Lord and worshipping, serving and obeying him and resting in him. We can rest in Jesus when we bring our sins to him, knowing he forgives us and restores us. Worshipping Jesus, thanking Jesus, giving our hearts to Jesus is the spirit of the Sabbath. We can overcome legalism when Jesus is at the heart of our Sabbath day. 

Look at verse 6. �On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shrivelled.� Jesus was teaching in the synagogue and people must have been enjoying his message, resting in the Lord. However in the congregation there was one man whose right hand was shrivelled. Most people are right handed and to have a shrivelled right hand was very serious. He was helpless and powerless. Look at verse 7. �The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.� Jesus had been trying to help the Pharisees understand God�s heart for the people, with the paralysed man, with the calling of Levi, by teaching them about David heart but the Pharisees and teachers of law did not care about this man. Instead, they were eager to find a reason to accuse Jesus. According to their rules, the only healing allowed on the Sabbath was if the case was life threatening, and this man didn�t qualify. Jesus must have been exasperated. He knew what they were thinking. They looked holy outwardly yet inside they were evil. They were just using this helpless man in order to accuse Jesus. What did Jesus then say to this man? �Get up and stand in front of everyone.� Jesus revealed the problem of this man before the whole congregation. The man stood up. Then Jesus challenged the teachers of law and Pharisees by asking a question in verse 9, �I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?� He cuts through all their legalistic nonsense with a simple question. Healing this man would be doing good whereas aiming to kill Jesus would obviously be evil on the Sabbath day. The Pharisees pretended as if they were righteous people, yet inwardly they were evil. Jesus wanted them to repent their jealousy and desire for religious power by asking this question. 

Look at verse 10. �He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, �Stretch out your hand.� He did so, and his hand was completely restored.� Jesus told the man to stretch out his hand. How shameful would he have felt. How much would he have wanted to hide it away. Yet, Jesus challenged him to stretch out his hand. This took faith and obedience, and the man needed to trust in Jesus love. It was hard for this man to obey Jesus. Fear and doubt, shame came into his heart. Yet, he obeyed. What happened? When he obeyed and stretched out his hand, his hand was completely restored.

Look at verse 11.  �But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.� Jesus paid a high price for healing this man. He didn�t want to wait to heal him, causing him more unnecessary suffering. He didn�t want to bow to the Pharisees� perverse rules which went against the spirit of the Lord�s Sabbath. He wanted to help the Pharisees to learn God�s love. Yet, they didn�t repent. They instead became furious and discussed what they might do to Jesus. Jesus risked his own life to heal the man with a shrivelled hand. Eventually this led to Jesus� crucifixion. In order to give us rest, Jesus gave his life for us.
 
?. Jesus who calls twelve apostles (12-19)

Look at verse 12. �One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.� �One of those days� refers to this period when teachers of law and Pharisees were furious and were discussing how to kill Jesus. Jesus had done his best to help them as Israel�s leaders, yet they had not repented, instead they were growing more and more hostile to God�s work. Meanwhile the people were suffering under their legalism and corruption. What did Jesus do at this time? He went to the mountain and prayed all night. Jesus knew his time in the world would not be long. He knew he would be crucified according to God�s will. The Pharisees reaction had recently made that more clear. It was time to choose from his disciples those who he could train to carry on after him. Yet Jesus did not decide these things by himself. He went to God in prayer. 

Here we must understand that it is God who chooses and calls his disciples. He chooses by his one sided grace and for his own purpose. In that sense, no one volunteers or chooses God. All we can do is thank him for the great privilege of his call. Moreover, in making disciples as Jesus commanded, we must respect God�s sovereignty and pray. Raising disciples is not a human business, it is God�s work. It cannot be done according to our will or plan or ability. Therefore we need to pray, even all night! When we pray to God wholeheartedly, he will raise his disciples.

Look at verse 13. �When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles.� He received God�s direction to raise up 12 apostles to serve the spiritually dark generation. The number 12 is significant, because it refers to the 12 tribes of Israel. Jesus had a sense of God�s history, and was making a new beginning in a new era of grace that would be for all the world. Also practically, choosing twelve meant that he could maintain an intimate relationship with them. Discipleship requires intimacy with Jesus and there is both an individual component and a collective component in raising disciples. Jesus could have increased the number, yet with the limited time he had the quality of discipleship would have suffered and probably they would not have persevered through all the persecution that was to come in the 1st century. Jesus raised only a few but raised them up as men of great faith who could continue the work of God. Raising up disciples was God�s great wisdom in realizing world mission.

When Jesus chose the twelve, he gave them a privileged status. They were designated as apostles. In that sense, they are unique in history. They would have special access to him in his most significant teachings and experiences. In the future, he would recognize them as legitimate carriers of his message, and as his representatives on earth. They would be the unique authors of the New Testament. Innumerable people would learn of Jesus through them. With their privilege came a responsibility to conform precisely to Jesus� will. They would be measured by a high standard. Who, then, were these men?

 �Simon (whom he named Peter).� Simon was passionate and somewhat outspoken. He seemed to be a natural leader. However, he had obvious weaknesses and made big mistakes. He seemed too unstable to be a truly effective leader. However, Jesus had a great hope for him from the very first day he saw him. Jesus gave him the name �Peter,� which means �Rock.� It meant he would be the rock of Jesus� church. Peter�s virtue was that he was willing to obey Jesus, simply because Jesus said so. This is an essential quality that enabled him to grow in Jesus. However, it was Jesus� deep grace of restoration that sustained Peter through his failures. In Jesus� hope and deep grace, Simon did become Peter, the rock of the early church.

�his brother Andrew.� Andrew is referred to as �Peter�s brother.� We may wonder how Andrew felt about this. According to John, Andrew brought Peter to Jesus. After that, Jesus paid most of his attention to Peter, and not much to Andrew. But Andrew did not mind. Andrew was not self-centered. Andrew was most cooperative. When Jesus wanted to feed a large crowd, Andrew understood Jesus� heart and brought five loaves and two fish to Jesus. Quiet men of good influence, like Andrew, are precious in God�s work.

�James, John.� They were brothers, the sons of Zebedee. Together with Simon and Andrew, they formed the nucleus of Jesus� band of disciples. But there was tension among them, and a running competition over who was number one. Once, when Jesus was nearing Jerusalem to suffer and die for sinners, James and John tried to claim positions at his right and left hand. It was a shameless power play that upset all of the other disciples. But Jesus taught them his humble servantship and his spirit of sacrifice. Finally they became the most sacrificial men of God. James was the first martyr among the twelve. John became the disciple of love, and a blessing to everyone.

�Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas.� Philip was especially sought out by Jesus, as John records. Bartholomew may be the same person as Nathanael, whom Philip brought to Jesus. Tradition says that after Christ had risen, Philip and Bartholomew coworked in various places, including Hierapolis, and that each died as a martyr. We met Matthew in chapter 5. Thomas was sick with doubt. But Jesus healed him and he became a witness of the resurrection. Later, he went to India as a missionary.

�James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.� James son of Alphaeus might have been Matthew�s brother. Simon the Zealot was a member of the nationalist party of Israel. He must have had a hard time getting along with Matthew. Judas son of James may be the son of Apostle James. Judas Iscariot became a traitor. Judas was called, chosen, loved and trained by Jesus, just as the others were. He alone failed to become a great man of God. According to John�s gospel, it was because he loved money more than Jesus. He stands as a warning to us not to love money, or the world, more than Jesus. Jesus knew that Judas would betray him. Still Jesus chose him. Jesus did not avoid the cross in choosing his apostles. Jesus followed God�s will.

Among the twelve we find people of various backgrounds, experiences and personalities. By choosing them, Jesus embraced each kind of person in an intimate and special way. This reveals his heart; Jesus embraces all kinds of people in the hope of raising them as great men of God. Everyone has hope in Jesus. Any kind of person can find a place in Jesus. This challenges us to learn Jesus� heart. Generally, we like to be with those we like, and to avoid those who make us uncomfortable. But with these 12 Jesus spent time with every kind of person, even a traitor. We should embrace many kinds of people. Then we can know the heart of Christ. Here we should thank God for the people in our lives who are contrary to us and most difficult to get along with. They are helping us to grow in the heart of Christ.

Most of all, we learn Jesus� great hope. Jesus chose ordinary men. Yet Jesus believed that they would become apostles who would bring the gospel to the world. And they did. Tradition tells us that each one preached the gospel powerfully and became a martyr, except for John. Jesus chooses the weak things of the world and uses them powerfully in history. In Jesus we have hope to be used greatly by God. We must live in this hope instead of in frustration and despair. We must also learn to see others with hope, and to invite them to Jesus. Jesus can raise weak people as great servants of God, and a blessing to the world.

How then did Jesus begin to train his apostles? Look at verses 17-19. �He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.� Jesus came down to a level place with them. In this part, we can see Luke�s unique perspective in regards to the training of the twelve apostles. In parallel passages, Matthew and Mark state that Jesus gave his apostles authority to preach and to drive out demons. However, Luke omits this and goes directly to Jesus� high standard of spiritual and moral life. Luke teaches us that Jesus� apostles must have godly character. Then their message will be powerful and effective.

Jesus took his disciples to a level place, surrounded by a needy crowd of people from all over Judea, and from the coastal towns of Tyre and Sidon, which were in Gentile territory. These people needed help to solve serious problems: diseases, sicknesses, and demon possession. They needed shepherds. Jesus welcomed them with compassion and healed them. Yet, in spite of their great need, Jesus also began to teach his disciples. He considered disciple raising a priority. So in the midst of a great demand from the crowd, Jesus raised disciples. We have to struggle hard just to survive. We face overwhelming demands. However, disciple raising must be a priority, and for this we must sacrifice.

In conclusion let�s pray to make Jesus Lord of the Sabbath in our hearts and learn God�s spirit behind the law. Jesus focused on raising 12 men in his generation whom he could train and raise as apostles. Raising spiritual leaders is the most essential and precious work of God in any generation. Let�s thank Jesus for calling us with his great hope and vision, and let�s keep praying to grow and make disciples in this generation.
