2010 Acts 10

THE CHURCH AT ANTIOCH 

Acts 11:19-12:25 
Key verses: 11:25,26
'Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.'

Last week, with the conversion of Cornelius we saw the 'Pentecost of the gentiles'. Luke's narrative could now move to James' martyrdom and Peter's imprisonment in chapter 12. But before doing so Luke inserted today's passage as a bridge and links back to Ch 8:4. In this he is telling us the centre of the gospel work is moving from Jerusalem to Antioch. In particular those who were scattered from the persecution in Jerusalem travelled to Antioch and preached the gospel to Gentiles. As we studied in chapter 8, the Samaritans who were evangelised by Philip were half Jews; Cornelius in chapter 10 already had a deep relationship with the Jews and was a 'God fearer' even though he was a Gentile. But those who accepted the gospel in Antioch were purely Gentiles. They had never heard of the gospel and appear to have had no Jewish root. This is a dramatic shift. Through today's message, may God help us to learn about the Antioch church ' the first Gentile church.

Look at verse 19. 'Now those who had been scattered by the persecution in connection with Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message only to Jews.' There was a great persecution in Jerusalem in connection with Stephen's martyrdom. Because of this, all the believers except the apostles had to leave Judea and were scattered throughout Samaria and the neighbouring Gentile regions. We have seen Saul trying to arrest believers as far away as Damascus which indicates a continuous pursuit and threat to those who had scattered. As a result they continued to flee as far as they could. In this there is God's mysterious sovereignty at work. God used such a persecution so that the gospel could be spread across the whole world. Though they appeared as lonely strangers who had left their families, relatives and hometowns, from God's point of view they were God's workers for world mission. 

Among them, some travelled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch. Phoenicia was located to the north west of Israel and is modern day Lebanon. There are two cities Tyre and Sidon along the Mediterranean coast where Jesus himself visited in the past (Mark 7). Cyprus is the Island in the northeastern Mediterranean, which faces Tarsus and Antioch. Barnabas was from Cyprus which in the OT is referred to as Kittim (Numbers 24:24). Antioch was the capital city of Syria and was 15 miles from the Mediterranean sea and about 300 miles from Jerusalem. At that time the Roman Empire had 16 cities named Antioch. In New Testament we read of two of these: Pisidian Antioch (13:14) and Syrian Antioch. Here it refers to Syrian Antioch. It was built around 300BC by Seleucos Nicator, one of the successors of Alexander. He named the city after his father, Antiochus. Syrian Antioch was the third largest city of the Graeco-Roman world after Rome and Alexandria. It was huge and had a population of around 500,000 people. Syrian Antioch stood between the West and the East and was geographically an important place because it could reach both cultures. As such Antioch was a good place for the world mission. It was famous for chariot racing and for a pursuit of pleasure. Antioch was famous for the worship of Daphne with a temple 5 miles out of the city whose priestesses were sacred prostitutes. Believers were scattered to this idolatrous Gentile city. But those who were scattered preached the gospel only to the Jews. It was because they had a prejudice towards the Gentiles. They perhaps saw their immoral idolatrous lives and thought they were beyond God's hope.

Look at verse 20. 'Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.' Jewish believers spoke only to the Jews but some men from Cyprus and Cyrene went to Antioch and spoke to the Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord. The Jews of Cyprus and Cyrene were already part of the Diaspora and had already gone some way to breaking that exclusivity and sense of superiority so they could tell them the gospel. What was the content of their preaching? They spoke about 'the Lord Jesus'. In other words, the point of the message was that Jesus is the Lord who died on the cross and rose again. This message was the theme of Peter's preaching at Pentecost (2:36). It was the core of his message to Cornelius (10:36). The believers preached the same message in Antioch. Today society has progressed and diversified and so the church serves various messages and communities. But regardless of the type of church, the most important message should always be Jesus' death on the cross for our sins and his resurrection. When other teaching is stressed more than the gospel the church can shift to pursue blessings or emotional enjoyment. It can drift from the bible and can even become a cult. May God help us to wholeheartedly preach the good news of the Lord Jesus, that by faith in the cross of Jesus for our sins and his resurrection we receive the grace of forgiveness and eternal life! 

When they told them the good news about the Lord, what happened to Gentiles in Antioch? Look at verse 21. 'The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.' The Lord's hand was with them. This is an Old Testament expression emphasising that the power of God was with them (2 Samuel 3:12). As a result, a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord. Gentiles became believers. It was an incredible work of God that Gentiles who had never heard of the gospel should became Christians. Thinking of this gentile idolatrous culture it could not be compared to the work of God in Cornelius through Peter. And who did this work? We don't know their names. It was not the apostles. It was not the 7 deacons. No ' it was done through anonymous ordinary believers sharing their faith. News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem. They must have been surprised at the news. Maybe some wondered if this was genuinely the work of God. They wanted to investigate the situation and sent Barnabas to Antioch (22). In the past when there was the work of God in Samaria they sent Peter and John but this time it was Barnabas. This was probably because Barnabas was from Cyprus, which was near Antioch, and he may have had relatives there and been more familiar with the culture. Anyway it with clearly the grace of God that he was sent as he was not someone with a rigid mind who made a god of the law.

What did he do when he arrived? Look at verse 23. 'When he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.' Barnabas saw the evidence of the grace of God. He saw gentiles accepting the Lord Jesus; he saw forgiveness and new life and was glad to see it. People tend to see the work of God done by others with an eye of suspicion, even jealousy. If not actively hostile then people are easily indifferent to others work. But Barnabas was glad when he saw the work of God that was taking place. He was a God-centred man. Furthermore, he encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. They were full of grace and truth as new believers. But the foundation to their faith was weak and they must have experienced continuous difficulties while living in an idolatrous unbelieving society. The focus of his help was not to commit to church work, or learn something special or new but to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. Notice the word all ' all of them needed to remain with all their hearts. They must not remain in Jesus for a short time but learn to continue to live with Him. This can be a battle for us ' we come and go in our commitment to Jesus; we get sidetracked on other things. But the key need is to stay close to Jesus. 

Barnabas realised that someone must be put in charge of this work. Having encouraged them it seems that came to have a sense of mission after seeing the evidence of the grace of God. He wanted to stay in order to help them. The author Luke tells us that Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith. Luke almost certainly knew Barnabas as a friend having travelled with Paul and the earlier believers. He records 'and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.' The word 'and' tells that it was because Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith that a great number of people came to believe. 'He was a good man' means he had a good character - good natured and friendly. Even today you cannot mention Barnabas to a believer without a sense of warmth being conveyed. He was a godly man full of the Holy Spirit and faith. With the help of Barnabas, a great number of people in Antioch were brought to the Lord and the church grew rapidly. We see here the importance of a good man full of the Holy Spirit and faith. Wherever he goes, he is preciously used. Barnabas was not an apostle but he was like an apostle in terms of his inner character and faith. May God help us overcome our limitations as lay bible teachers and grow as influential servants of God like Barnabas. 

Yet despite the growth Barnabas recognized more was needed. He saw that he alone could not serve the growing work of God in Antioch. He needed a co-worker. That person must be someone with a double background, a Jew who could meet gentiles on equal terms and reason with them. Who did he look for? Look at verse 25. 'Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul'. Saul had immediately began to preach Jesus after meeting him on the way to Damascus. But it seems he needed time to mature. He had been somewhat divisive while in Jerusalem and had been sent to his hometown Tarsus (9:30, 22:17-21). We don't know exactly how long he stayed in Tarsus but many suggest it was around 10 years. The reason for this is that in Galatians Paul writes that visited Jerusalem a second time after 14 years (Gal 2:1). If we take away the year spent in Antioch (26), the gap is about 13 years. Barnabas knew about God's calling on Saul for the gentiles and had been the man to go and see him and bring him first to Jerusalem. He believed that Saul was the man God sent for the work of God in Antioch. He looked for him in Tarsus. The word 'look for' means 'to search out' ' to track down each house one by one. Some speculate that he had been thrown out of his parent's home for becoming a believer and so was hard to find (Php 3.8). Barnabas did not give up but persistently looked for him and at last he found him. Saul must have been glad to see Barnabas. As he explained the work of God in Antioch Saul agreed to help. Look at verse 26. 'and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.' Barnabas brought Saul to Antioch. 

What can we learn from Barnabas who gained Saul as his co-worker? First, Barnabas had a spiritual eye for people. Though Saul's character had some aspects that needed to be rounded, Barnabas recognised that he was like a diamond hidden in the mud. He saw how God could use this man. He did not see the man as he was but saw his potential. In short he saw with God's vision. Second, we learn his humility. He was one of the leaders in the Jerusalem church. He was the one specially selected to be go to Antioch. Yet Saul was not well known as an evangelist. But he saw in Saul an excellent teacher and evangelist who would surpass him. People often want glory for themselves or select co-workers who will follow them rather than challenge. But Barnabas looked for a co-worker with a bigger spiritual capacity than himself. He did not worry about being second when he was with Saul. He put God's work first rather than himself and he was pleased when the gospel was preached and Jesus was honoured. In short he was humble and God centred. No wonder Luke says he was a good man full of the Holy Spirit and faith! 

Thanks to Barnabas, Saul ended this hidden period of his life and started a new life as an apostle to the Gentiles just as he had been called to do in Damascus (9:5,15). The result of this was that Saul did not serve the Gentile mission while based in the Jerusalem church but chose Antioch which had many more advantages for a world mission strategy. We see everything was under God's sovereignty and perfect leading. 

Barnabas brought Saul to Antioch and together taught a great number of people. Their co-working was based on the Word. It was very powerful and bore considerable fruit. Disciples began to live Jesus-centred lives and they passionately witnessed to Christ. So much so that others nicknamed the disciples Christians. The people of Antioch were famous for finding sarcastic nicknames. Later the bearded emperor Julian came to visit the city - they nicknamed him 'the Goat'. Christianoi means belonging to the party of Christ i.e. they were Christ's men. It indicated the word Christ was always on their lips. The word Christian appears three times in the New Testament (26:28, 1Peter 4:16) and was adopted in the second century by believers as the name for themselves. But we see the origin was a derisory nickname given to believers who looked mad for Christ. People called the reformers 'Protestant' and Wesley's and his church were dubbed as merely 'Methodists' but these became glorious expressions. Believers in Antioch were devoted to Christ. So much so it was others who called them Christians. This underlines how much the teaching of Barnabas and Saul affected their lives. Saul played a main part in persecuting believers before his conversion. In fact those who evangelized the Greeks in Antioch were believers scattered because of Saul's persecution. Ironically even before faith he helped create the Antioch church! After Saul's conversion and hidden years of training in Tarsus he directly did a great job in building the Antioch church through teaching. It was God's mysterious sovereignty that God used Saul's passion both indirectly and directly in establishing the Antioch church. 

Look at verse 27. 'During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.' When the Antioch church grew some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. We don't know why they came - perhaps seeking a relief offering. One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. What was God's will in prophesying about this famine? First, God wanted people to have firm faith in God through the fulfilment of this prophecy. Second, God wanted people to know that disasters did not come by chance but by God's sovereignty and to help them to repent. As predicted, there was a succession of bad harvests and serious famines in parts of the empire. This happened during the reign of Caesar Claudius (AD 41-54).  So the disciples, each according to his ability, decided to provide help for the brothers living in Judea. Gentile believers in Antioch were not indifferent to Jewish believers in Jerusalem who did not embrace them. Rather they looked after them. They were not narrow people bound by nationalism and a concern only for themselves and 'their ministry'. They practiced Jesus' command 'to love one another'. They regarded the Jewish believers in Jerusalem as part of the church and sacrificially served them. 

Chapter 12 is in contrast to chapter 11. It describes Herod's persecution of the Jerusalem church and God's intervention. Look at verses 1 and 2. 'It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them. He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.' Here 'King Herod' is the grandson of Herod the great, Herod Agrippa. He was a childhood friend of Claudius appointed him as a king of Judah (AD 37-44). He was politically ambitious and persecuted Christianity in order to gain favour with the Jews. His persecution was to kill the apostles who remained in Jerusalem. He arrested John's brother James and put him to death by the sword. The Jews were pleased with this. In order to continue with this, Herod arrested Peter the head of the Jerusalem church. This happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread with the intention of imprisoning Peter until he could be killed after the Passover. Up until now the persecution had come from religious leaders but this is the first time we read of persecution from the mainstream political sources. Peter was guarded by four squads of four soldiers. 16 people to hold one man! Peter was facing death and the church faced a great crisis with the possible loss of its leader. 

At that time what did the church do? Look at verse 5. 'So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.' They did not hold a political rally and demonstration. They did not try to lobby Herod. Rather the church was earnestly praying to God for him. We don't read of this when James was seized and perhaps the death of James has woken the church to the importance and need of prayer. And clearly prayer made a powerful difference. On hearing their prayer what did God do? The night before trial, an angle of the Lord appeared to Peter. At that time Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. One hand chained to one soldier and the other to another. He slept with no belt and shoes. Despite the lack of comfort he was evidently deeply in sleep. So much so the angel of the Lord had to shake him. But this did not wake up so he struck Peter on the side and woke him up. He said, 'Quick, get up!' and the chains fell off Peter's wrists. Peter put on his clothes and sandals and followed the angel out of the prison.

Peter went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark. There many people had gathered and were praying for Peter's release. Yet when the servant girl, Rhoda, told them Peter was at the door they thought she was out of her mind. When she kept insisting that it was so they concluded it must be his angel. Finally as Peter kept on knocking they finally opened the door and saw him and were astonished. It's ironic that the church was praying yet when God answered so quickly and clearly they did not believe it! In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. Evidently Herod refused to believe the account of the guards and instead had them executed and 16 innocent men died because of his unbelief. 

Verses 20-24 records the final end of Herod. Luke sketches the history behind this tyrant's death. We do not know the reason but Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They were fearful of Herod stopping their food which was supplied  from Judah. They would be vulnerable to Herod redirecting trade from these port cities and so they wanted to make peace with him. On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. They shouted, 'This is the voice of a god, not of a man. Herod did not give praise to God, and immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died'. Josephus records his death in some detail and talks of him becoming sick in his stomach and dying after 5 days (Jos Ant xix 8:2). The point Luke makes is simply that the end of this persecutor was really miserable. God struck him down. In contrast to this, the word of God continued to increase and spread. God's work continues regardless of persecution no matter how strong and powerful it may appear. 

In conclusion, the church at Antioch was a church of co-working between Barnabas and Saul with the word at its centre. The church absolutely stood on the word of Christ. Though the church was young, it was sacrificial and sent a generous offering to her mother church. It was not a receiving church but a giving church. God would preciously use this church as the head quarters of world mission. May God bless our church to become like Antioch in co-working with each other in one heart, deeply learn and teach the word of God and sacrificially giving and serving. May God preciously use our church for world mission!
