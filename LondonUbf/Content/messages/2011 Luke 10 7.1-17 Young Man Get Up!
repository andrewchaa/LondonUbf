2011 Luke 10

YOUNG MAN GET UP!


Luke 7:1-17
Luke 7:14 

�Then he went up and touched the coffin they were carrying him on, and those carrying it stood still. He said, �Young man, I say to you, get up!� 
 
In today�s passage Jesus heals a centurion�s servant with his word. By his word alone, he also revives a dead young man. May God help us to have faith to trust in the power of Jesus� word for ourselves and for those we serve.
?�Lord�say the word� (1-10)
Look at verses 1-2. �When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. There a centurion�s servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.� Jesus had been teaching his disciples and the people to come to him, hear his words and put them into practice. He now returns to Capernaum, which is the town where he had previously driven a demon out of a man in the synagogue and had healed a paralysed man.  One day a centurion�s servant got ill. Luke the doctor says he was dying, which means he had been getting worse and worse and now his body had lost the battle with the illness. The centurion could have just given him up and found a new servant. This would not have been unusual for a Roman. Servants were often regarded simply as instruments. The mind set in Jesus� time was that there were three types of instrument � one like a hammer and the other like cow or horse and the third was a servant. People regarded servants as commodities. Yet, the centurion did not give him up easily. He regarded him not as an instrument or tool but as a precious person. He valued his servant highly and loved him genuinely as his master, to the point that he personally does everything he can to help him. This man was not just a hired hand, and as a good shepherd nor was this centurion.  When he heard of Jesus, who had already become known for his miracles in Capernaum he asked the elders of Jews to go and ask for Jesus to come and heal his servant.

The elders of Jews did as he asked. Look at verses 4-5. �When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, �This man deserves to have you do this, because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.� Often, the elders of the Jews were and hostile to gentiles. Yet, even they acknowledged the centurion�s love for them and their nation. The centurion was a soldier. Usually a soldier�s power lies in the sword. Yet, he genuinely loved Jewish people instead of exercising his power over them. This centurion had built their synagogue, whether he had personally put money up for it, or had got his troops to help out in building it is not mentioned. But the point is his genuine, pure love had even won over the proud elders of the Jews who gave their hearts to him. We begin to get a portrait of this centurion as an exceptional man. It is said that love is more powerful than the sword, but it�s remarkable that this Roman soldier, who was trained to fight, conquer and punish understands this so completely. His service of the Jews meant they were willing not only to be his messenger but to plead his cause. 

It says, �So Jesus went with them.� Jesus was pleased to hear of this centurion�s compassion and wanted to go and heal the servant. In those days, Jews were not allowed to enter gentiles� houses. Jesus knew this but for him saving a soul was more important. Look at verses 6-7. �So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: ?ord, don�t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.� From this we can have insight into the centurion�s faith, expressed by humility and his trust in Jesus� word. First, let�s think about his humility. The centurion said that he didn�t even deserve to have Jesus come under his roof. The elders had told Jesus, �this man �deserves� to have you do this.� Yet here the centurion says the complete opposite; he knows he is �unworthy�. This reveals that the centurion had a better understanding of who Jesus was, and who he was asking to help him than the elders. Before God no one is worthy, we do not deserve anything, no amount of good works or morality can mean we deserve anything from God. All we can do is ask for his grace. It seems the centurion understood this even though the elders didn�t. Secondly, the centurion had complete faith in the power of Jesus� word. He believed that Jesus� word itself was more than enough to heal his servant. At first, he had wanted Jesus to come and heal him, but later he became convinced that even the virus in his servant�s body would absolutely obey Jesus� command. His eyes were open to the world of faith!
How could he find this truth? Look at verse 8. �For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, �Go,� and he goes; and that one, �Come,� and he comes. I say to my servant, �Do this,� and he does it.�  He understood the principle of faith through his daily life in the army. He realised the mechanisms of army life which involve absolute commands and obedience are exactly the same as with faith. The centurion realised that Jesus was the Commander in Chief and the virus/illness was a mere soldier who has to obey Him. The Commander in Chief normally doesn�t order a foot soldier face-to-face. His word is enough. And whatever he says, the foot soldiers under his authority would say �yes, sir.� The Centurion�s understanding of Jesus is so amazing. He knew that Jesus was the king of kings with all authority � for both things visible and invisible (Col 1:16). His finding of Jesus is based on his daily obedient life. To know Jesus, we need to learn obedience in our practical day to day life. Many people however know Jesus with only head knowledge and live disobedient lives. However, we can learn true faith only through our absolute and sincere obedience. When we don�t obey, we can�t grow in faith. 
His faith amazed even Jesus. Look at verse 9. �When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, �I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.� Israel is the home of faith, where numerous men and women of faith are from. Yet, even so, he hadn�t seen such great faith in Israel. The centurion was a Roman. He didn�t have a religious background. Yet, he had simple and absolute faith to trust in the power of Jesus� word. This is the ultimate faith that Jesus wants from us. When Jesus was in this world, he served, healed and taught many people. Yet, he had only 3 and half years which was a very limited time. After that, he was to be crucified. After he rose again, he now sits at the right hand of God. Because of this people don�t see Jesus face to face and now, only Jesus� words are available. Jesus was training his disciples for the time when he would no longer be with them. But, his disciples had long way to go. Yet, out of blue, he found such faith in this Roman centurion. 

The centurion teaches us faith to confess Jesus as our Saviour without seeing his appearance or voice.  He shows us a great example of faith that pleases and amazes Jesus and moves him. That faith means putting our trust in his word alone. God works powerfully when we have true and absolute faith in his word. These days such simple faith, that doesn�t question but simply believes seems at odds with the way people think; we tend to be more complicated in our thinking. How can we learn to have the faith that amazes Jesus? The answer is simple. We should do so by firmly holding onto the word of God � not superficially but firmly with absolute obedience. We can�t save a soul by being a good friend or being nice. But we can do so by helping them to hear and obey one living word of God. May God help each of us to grow in faith in trusting in his word and become men and women of God who pleases him. 

II �Young man, I say to you, get up!� 

Look at verse 11,12. �Soon afterwards, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out�the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.� We should take a moment to understand how sorrowful this widow would have been. She was a widow, which meant death had already robbed her of her husband; she had already lost her life partner, the one she had hoped would accompany her well into old age. Her son was probably her only remaining hope. Now she was burying him. It is said that when we lose a parent we lose our past, but if we lose a child we lose our future. This woman had lost everything; what hope could she have left, how could she look forward to a future? Death had torn everything she had loved right out of her. Some of us have lost parents, and close relatives. We have seen first hand how death, particularly untimely death devastates families and loved ones. It is fair to say my sister never fully recovered from the death of her mother and then on Christmas day last year her husband died suddenly of a stroke. She has been devastated over this last year. That is just one story in my family, but death effects everyone.

Because death is such a universal problem people mistakenly think it is natural, and then try to help people by getting them to just accept it. There is a story of how Buddha tried to help a woman who lost her son. He said �I will help you after you cook me rice taken from a household where there is no death.� She went to a village and went to every household to find one that hadn�t experienced death, but she couldn�t do so. She instead found the truth that death is every body�s destiny�Buddha�s implication is that therefore she shouldn�t worry about it so much. But what help or comfort is that? Nothing in this world can help us overcome our death problem. 

No one could comfort this woman. What possibly could you say to her? Have you been in that situation, not knowing what to say, what words could possibly be any comfort? Yet in verse 13 it says, �when the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, �Don�t cry.� What is interesting is the woman didn�t come to Jesus, he saw her, his heart went out her. Jesus approached the widow and told her �Don�t cry.� Can you imagine at a funeral going up to the grieving woman and saying this, talk about inappropriate! No one can say this. Even if they did, they couldn�t do anything about the woman�s anguish. To say these words without being able to do anything about the situation would at best, be ineffectual, at worse cruel. So what was Jesus saying? He meant that he would solve the root cause of her sorrow so she would not want to cry any more. Here we see the difference between Jesus and any other person. Who has risen from the dead and has the power of resurrection? Who then can wake up the dead man in the coffin? 
Look at verse 14. �Then he went up and touched the coffin they were carrying him on, and those carrying it stood still. He said, �Young man, I say to you, get up!� A better word for a coffin here is �bier.� It refers to an open coffin or even the plank of wood used to carry a dead person to the grave. That means the man was absolutely visible, his death plain for everyone to see. I have seen two dead people in my life, in both cases, death renders the person as a shell; they become hardly recognisable. For Jesus to touch the coffin was shocking as for any Jew it would render him unclean. Yet Jesus reaches out to the coffin, and raises the man from the dead with the words, �Young man I say to you, get up!� In doing so he is showing clearly who he is. He is the only one who can solve the problem of death. To Jesus, death is not the end or something to be depressed about, because in Jesus there is life and resurrection. John 11:25-26 says, �Jesus said to her, �I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies� and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?� There is no death in Jesus. Jesus overcame the power of death and so, he became the only true comfort of this woman. Jesus not only understands but solves this woman�s sorrow. 
Though the degree might differ � people tend live under the power of death. The thought of death oppresses and constrains people�s lives. But, Jesus� word has power to raise up the dead. It has the power to raise up spiritually dead souls. Only Jesus� words can give us true life and wake us from our spiritual slumber. At times, when we try to help people, we find our limit. Yet, we need to pray that Jesus� words may work in power so that they can wake from their spiritual slumber and receive life from Jesus. Think of ourselves. We were once spiritually dead but the word of Jesus gave us true life in him. May God help our bible students also to hear Jesus� words and receive life.
Look at verse 14 again. �Then he went up and touched the coffin they were carrying him on, and those carrying it stood still. He said, �Young man, I say to you, get up!� He didn�t say �Dead man, get up� He said �Young Man, Get up� People in coffins tend to be the most helpless. The dead man was also helpless. He was young but his life was snatched by death. Yet, still he called him �young man�. He had hope for this dead man to live again as a �young man�.

What are the characteristics of young men? They are active, energetic, dynamic � full of challenging spirit and passion. They are pure and have a desire for truth and righteousness. Most of all, they have dreams and vision for the future. Particularly young men in God have dreams that come from God. Joseph in the Old Testament had a dream given by God. Because of the dream, he could endure all misunderstanding and hardship. Visions and dreams without God may sustain a young man�s life for a while but soon, if they are not from God, the dreams will wither and end in meaninglessness. God�s vision sometimes requires us to deny ourselves and take up our crosses. Yet, as time goes by, this makes us strong and free and gives us the power of life. When we have dreams that are from Jesus, we can live as young men full of vision. God gave each of us a vision to be missionaries bible shepherds and disciples of Jesus. This vision enables and inspires us to reach out even in our old age � even in our busy lives � and faithfully plant the word of God in students� hearts. 

We can learn Jesus� hope in calling the dead person � young man. In this world, many people are physically alive but live without any vision or liveliness. Many people are in the coffin of fear and anxiety. Some are in the coffin of selfishness and loneliness. Some are in the coffin of defeatism � living in this super competitive world. Sometimes we can lose our young man�s spirit. How could we recover and be revived by the life of Jesus? All we need is to hear Jesus� words. Jesus� word cuts through failure, disappointment, discouragement that kills our spirit and threatens to put us into coffins. When we hear Jesus� words will get up again and try again by faith. Then we can have the vision to conquer the universities with God�s life-giving word. 

Jesus gave the young man back to his mother. People were all filled with awe and praised God. A great prophet has appeared among us,� they said. �God has come to help his people.� This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country. 

In this passage one man is dying, another man is dead. In Each case it is Jesus� word that brings and restores life. I personally learn that I first need to find again the simplicity and directness of the centurion�s faith. He simply and absolutely trusted in the authority and power of Jesus� word. Yesterday I met another guy who showed an interest in Bible study and we have an appointment on Tuesday. Yet I found in my heart preparing this message all kinds of negative thinking, based on past experience that made me doubt that God would work. The centurion had his servant close to death yet didn�t doubt the power of Jesus word to heal him. Jesus then demonstrated even further the power of his word to dramatically in raise the young man from death. What I listen to matters, if I listen to past failures, complicated thinking, I age very quickly, I lose man young man�s spirit, and become tired and fatalistic. But if I listen to Jesus, whose words have unimaginable and unthinkable power, I can recover my spirit and have vision for this guy I have met. All he needs, all my sister needs, all anyone needs is to hear Jesus� words �Young man, I say to you, get up!
