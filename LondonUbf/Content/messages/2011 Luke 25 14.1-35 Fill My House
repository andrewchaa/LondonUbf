2011 Luke 25

FILL MY HOUSE

Luke 14:1-35
Key verse 14:23
�Then the master told his servant, �Go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in, so that my house will be full. 

Last week Jesus called us to make every effort to enter through the narrow door. The door to the Kingdom is very narrow and it is only by Jesus. What�s on the other side of the door? Jesus describes it as a great banquet. Will all the people invited through the door enter? Sadly not. Yet God�s heart is clear: make them come so that my house will be full. God prepares a heavenly banquet and invites all sinners. He wants as many as possible to come to him. May we hear God�s heart and respond to his invitation. 

I. Take the lowest place (1-14)                   

Look at verses 1-2: �One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. There in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy.� One Sabbath Jesus was invited to the house of a prominent Pharisee. It�s a dinner party but the atmosphere is tense. Rather than enjoying the food or conversation with Jesus they were carefully watching him to see whether or not he would heal on the Sabbath. Placed in front of Jesus was a man suffering from dropsy. It seems fairly clear that this was a set up and that they wanted Jesus to violate the Sabbath to give them proof that he was not from God. Dropsy is a disease of water retention. It�s a symptom of more serious problems such as failure of the liver, kidney or the heart or even all three. The Rabbinical view was that somebody with this condition was a sinner �perhaps related to sexual sin or alcoholism. He was seen as wicked and unclean. The Pharisees did not care about this poor man but used him as to trap Jesus� �Do a miracle so we can be sure not to believe in you�. They are supposed to keep people from breaking the law yet they want Jesus to heal the man and break their law.  Their thinking was twisted and backwards. Although Jesus knew their intention he did not back down but challenged them in verse 3: �Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?� But they remained silent (4). The answer is that it is lawful and Jesus does heal the man. On doing this Jesus asked, �If one of you has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?� Of course if their son fell into a well they would immediately pull him out. Why? Because of love for their son. Can you imagine if your son fell in and was calling out saying �Oh wait until tomorrow�. No! If their ox fell in a well of course they would immediately pull it out. Why? Because an ox was valuable and they would need to buy another one. Jesus revealed they lacked compassion, lacked mercy, lacked kindness and that they loved money. He revealed their self righteousness and twisted thinking. It was a moment to repent yet their response? Verse 6: �And they had nothing to say.� The lunch was not going according to plan for the Pharisees and it was going to get worse for them.

Look at verse 7: �When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honour at the table he told them this parable�. Jesus observed the guests at the meal and noticed that people were fighting over the seats of honour. They wanted to sit near the prominent Pharisee. Those who were late felt hurt that places of honour were already occupied. What parable did Jesus tell them? Look at verses 8-10. �When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honour, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, �Give this man your seat.� Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place. But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, �Friend, move up to a better place.� Then you will be honoured in the presence of all your fellow guests� (8-10). What was Jesus� conclusion? Look at verse 11: �For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.� This world teaches us that we must be number 1 even though we have to push other people aside to get there. But Jesus teaches us that we have to take the lower seats and humble ourselves. Why do we have to be humble people? It is because those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted. Those who exalt are those that seek worldly glory, status and position. They are proud and ambitious for their own recognition. Such a heart makes us stubborn and rude and dulls spiritual insight. Such a heart is unhappy and looses peace. It�s a heart full of complaint, bitterness, anger and wounds. Pride is foolishness. It results in destruction in the end as Proverbs tells us, �Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall  (Pro 16:18)� God brings down those who exalt themselves and humiliates them. But God gives grace to those who humble themselves. God declares in Isaiah, �For this is what the high and exalted One says� he who lives forever, whose name is holy: �I live in a high and holy place, but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite� (Isa 57:15).

Jesus overturns the conventional wisdom of this world. Look at verses 12-14: �Then Jesus said to his host, �When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbours; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.� Having seen the guests squabbling for places Jesus turns his attention to the host, the prominent Pharisee. Although he had given a banquet and appeared to serve others, Jesus revealed this was selfishness. Although he gave a banquet and invited people he was basically thinking of his own benefit. When inviting others people think of what they get in return. But Jesus encouraged the host to invite �the poor, the crippled, the lame and the blind�. Unlike the rich neighbours these were people that could never repay with favours, money or influence. This sounds noble to serve the poor, the crippled, the lame and the blind. As Christians we know we are called to serve. Yet a ministry devoted to serving students can be one without reward or thanks. It can be slow. People can be needy and weak. It feels like losing. So how can we invite the poor, the crippled, the blind and lame? Notice the great blessing in verse 14, �Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.�   God sees. God rewards. God repays. 

II. Fill my house (15-24)

The dinner party is now rather awkward. Jesus has frustrated their plans to trap him; revealed the selfishness and lack of compassion; and basically said that they are too proud to enter the Kingdom of God. Then one man speaks up. Look at verse 15: �When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, �Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.� This almost sounds like a toast as if he has raised his glass of wine and said �Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God� and they all said �yes�. This man seemed to have confidence that he would eat at the feast in the kingdom of God because he was a Jew and Pharisee. He was rejecting what Jesus had just said. What parable did Jesus tell them after hearing him? Look at verses 16- 17. �Jesus replied: "A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, 'Come, for everything is now ready.'�  A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. He planned in detail the fabulous food, the best meats and fine wine. He planned music, many instruments, various dancing, colourful costumes and decoration. For a long time, he planned and prepared for this great celebration. His plan was to invite many people and therefore he thought about arranging enough seats, enough food and enough accommodation. When everything was ready and the time for the banquet came, he sent his servants to tell to those who had been invited. �Come, for everything is now ready.� He expected that those who had been invited would come with joy and a sense of privilege. It would be ridiculous to say no. 

But how did they respond? Look at verse 18-20: �But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, �I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.� Another said, �I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I�m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.� Still another said, �I just got married, so I can�t come.� Everybody said I cannot come. They all came up with ridiculous excuses. The first mentioned his field and perhaps thought of the huge profit he was to make. Likewise the second could not wait to try out his ox. The third is perhaps the most ridiculous as if a wife would not like to attend a fabulous banquet and eat great food. The point is clear � these laughable excuses were obviously ridiculous. They were treating the man�s tremendous generosity and kindness with utter indifference and disdain.  

Of course this banquet refers to the heavenly banquet in the Kingdom of God. Isaiah 25:6 talks of a feast with rich food, aged wine � the best meats and the finest of wines. It�s a great picture where the Lord will swallow up death forever; he will wipe away every tear. This is a place of God�s abounding love and where people will rejoice and be glad in his salvation (Isa 26:9). The Jews were aware of the feast as verse 15 shows. Yet Jesus was saying that those who rejected the invitation were the Jews and Pharisees. Outwardly the Pharisees seemed to value the heavenly banquet and respect God. But in reality like those who rejected the invitation with ridiculous excuses, they were occupied by greed and worldly pleasure. They rejected Jesus� gospel message and invitation to the heavenly banquet. They thought they were chosen people and blessed to eat in heavenly banquet. But through this parable, Jesus helped them realize that they would not join the banquet. 

So when they rejected the invitation what did the master do? Did he have a banquet only with his servants? Did he cancel the banquet out of disappointment? Look at verse 21.  �The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, �Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.�� He was angry. Their rejection treated him with contempt. It ignored his generosity and despised his authority. His great banquet was less important than trivial business opportunities. Likewise to reject the invitation of the gospel is to despise God�s grace and reject his love. It leaves nothing but God�s anger. Until now this is what we would expect but look again at verse 21b. �Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.�� He commanded his servants to go into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame. The poor were not like those who possessed fields or oxen. The crippled were wounded damaged people. The blind were those wandering in darkness unable to see things. The lame were those who were limping. In short they were those damaged by sin - sinners and prostitutes who accepted the gospel. They were despised in the world because they did not have anything. They did not buy fields and oxen. They could not marry. But because of this they were poor in heart and accepted Jesus� invitation to the heavenly banquet. As Corinthians says, �But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things�and the things that are not�to nullify the things that are.� (1 Co 1:27- 28).
  
How far does this invitation extend? Look at verse 22: ��Sir,� the servant said, �what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.�� Though the servants brought in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame, there was still room. So what did the master do? Was he satisfied with those who came? No. He wanted more to come. Look at verses 23-24. �Then the master told his servant, �Go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in, so that my house will be full. I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.�� Now he commanded his servants to go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in so that the house would be full. This means that all peoples including Gentiles will be invited to the heavenly banquet.  What do we learn from the master through this?

First, God invites all humanity to his kingdom. Revelation 19 talks about the wedding banquet of the Lamb: �Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready. Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear�Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!� The banquet of the Lamb is the banquet of salvation. What has God prepared for the banquet? God has prepared the most valuable things: not simply great food and wine. He has prepared forgiveness of sin and eternal life for all those who come to the wedding banquet. He has prepared real joy and happiness that all people who attend. God has prepared everything and invites us. God wants to bless all mankind. (Num 6:24-26) God does not want to lose even one person. (Mt 18:14) Those who are invited and come to the banquet are blessed.
 
Second, there is no difference among men. The Jews, God�s chosen people, were invited first. But most rejected God�s invitation. Now the wedding banquet is wide open to everyone. Anyone, whether you are a Jew or not, young or old, man or woman, can come. Romans 3:22 says, �This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference�. Romans 10:12 also says, �For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile-- the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him,� God has prepared the beautiful feast in the kingdom of God. In order to join the incredible feast people do not need to do anything. All they have to do is to just accept the invitation and come.    

Third, in the end God judges those who ignore his invitation. God is gracious and he has prepared everything for our happiness. He humbles himself and invites everyone. However, God�s judgment comes upon those who do not appreciate his love and instead pour contempt on his kindness, tolerance, and patience. As verse 24 says those who rejected his invitation do not even get a taste of his banquet. 

Fourth, we were invited to the feast simply because of his grace. We were like those on the streets and alleys of the town. We were the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame. We were spiritually poor, crippled by sin, damaged and wounded. We had no right to attend but by God�s grace we were invited to the great banquet. We have nothing to be proud of. It's God�s grace to be invited. It's God�s grace to stay. In some ways grace is hard to accept. Can you imagine receiving an invitation to the recent royal wedding of Prince William and Kate? You get an email or a letter with the invitation. You would think �That�s ridiculous. That cannot be right. It�s a trick or a joke�. God�s invitation is infinitely greater than to the royal wedding. We did not deserve or earn it � it�s simply Jesus� incredible grace.

Fifth this parable is a warning. Who were the Jews? Ungrateful slaves set free from the cruelty of Pharaoh by God�s grace. Yet over time they moved from former slave people to thoughts of prominence, status and position. They took it for granted and thought they were important and deserved God�s blessing. The Pharisees thought that they were somebody. So much so they used a man with dropsy simply as bait. There was no compassion or love for him. And what about us? Over time we can take God�s invitation for granted. We can think we are important in God�s work � �Phew! God must be pleased I am around. He could not get his job done without me. He needs people like me. Thankfully with me in the mission and my holy life the job can be done�. Worse still we can look around at others and say �Oh no! There are all these lame, blind and crippled people. They are the problem!�  For others there are excuses. We are more interested in our houses, our families, our jobs than in responding to Jesus. 

Last, sharing God�s heart. Verse 23 says �Go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in, so that my house will be full�. Make them come in. Make is a strong word. This sounds like a call to obedience as if we have to do this reluctantly and force people to respond. We can do this. But it misses the real motive. God�s heart is that his house will be full. God wants all people to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth (1 Ti 2:4). He longs for those to go out and plead for others to come in. This parable of the great banquet was the last sermon D.L. Moody ever preached. It was called, "Excuses." He preached it on 23 November 1899 in Kansas City. At the time, he was very unwell but he said, "Never, never have I wanted so much to lead men and women to Christ as I do this time!" There was a throbbing in his chest, and he had to hold on to the organ to stop himself from falling over. But Moody preached the gospel and about 50 people responded to trust in Jesus. A month later he died. To the end, Moody knew God�s heart and was compelled to �make them come in�. John Stott describes this motive when he says �The highest of all missionary motives is neither obedience to the Great Commission (important as that is), nor love for sinners who are alienated and perishing (strong as that incentive is, especially when we contemplate the wrath of God) but rather zeal � burning and passionate zeal � for the glory of Jesus Christ. � Before this supreme goal of the Christian mission, all unworthy motives wither and die.� God is zealous to see all at the wedding feast of the lamb and wants us to be zealous for his glory. Make them come in is a call to bring glory to God and to save life. 

III. The cost of being a disciple (25-35)

First, Jesus expects our first love (25-27). Jesus was no longer at the Pharisee's dinner party. Large crowds were traveling with him. But Jesus wasn't interested as much in quantity of followers as he was in quality. Turning to them he said some very difficult words: "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters--yes, even his own life--he cannot be my disciple. And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple." Why does Jesus say a true disciple must hate his family members and his own life? After all, Jesus taught, "Love your enemies." Other gospel passages help us to understand what Jesus meant. Matthew 10:37-39 gives a similar teaching: "Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it." Jesus expects first place in the life of his disciple. Jesus expects priority in heart over family and self. It is very clear that Jesus calls us to full commitment and devotion. Jesus did not offer any discount discipleship. Jesus did not mention temp job disciples.

Second, giving up everything (28-35). Jesus gave two short parables to explain the cost of discipleship: building a tower and going to war. If we stopped in the middle of building a tower or a house because we ran out of money, that would be ridiculous, not to mention a great waste of time, money and effort. Also, to begin a battle without training or confidence in our forces would be foolish and fatal. Jesus adds, "In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple." Following Jesus is all or nothing. Jesus did not advertise a discipleship trial period with a money-back guarantee. The question is: how can God expect us to give up everything? He can do so because he gave us everything when he gave Jesus to save us. Jesus gave up everything and died on the cross for us. Can we give him any less? Jesus wants his disciples to be salty, not to blend in unnoticed with the world. 

God�s heart is to see all come in. He longs to celebrate the wedding feast of the Lamb. How desperate is God to see this happen? He sent his one and only son to die on the cross for our sins. This is the great invitation. This is the calling card of God�s love for man. May God bless us to realize the grace of his invitation and with thankfulness and zeal invite many to his Kingdom.
