2010 Acts 3

IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH, WALK!

Acts 3:1-26                                                      
Key verse: 3:6
    Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk."

 Last week we learnt about the birth of the early church through the coming of the Holy Spirit. In today's passage we see a miracle which made the early church flourish. We also see Peter's powerful message to the Jews. Through the healing of the crippled man we can learn about the power of Jesus' name and that when we have faith in his name we can heal those who are spiritually crippled in our generation. May God change us into powerful disciples of Jesus through faith in the living Jesus.

Look at verse 1 'One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer'at three in the afternoon' The Jews in those days prayed 3 times a day at 9am, midday and 3pm. Peter and john went to the temple at the time of prayer. In the past they did not co-work well together. Peter was hot tempered and forceful while John was thoughtful and ambitious. Also in the past they had not been men of prayer, rather they were men of action and sleep. But now they were change by the Holy Spirit; they co-worked closely and prayed together. That they went up to the temple at the time of prayer shows that Peter and John saw no problem in continuing their Jewish custom of prayer at certain hours of the day. It is a great benefit to set a specific time in which we come to God. When we do so we are able to overcome our laziness and busy mindedness and give time to God.

Look at verse 2 'Now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.' The Jewish historian Josephus describes the Beautiful gate as being made of fine Corinthian brass. It was seventy-five feet high with huge double doors, so beautiful that it 'greatly excelled those that were only covered over with silver and gold.'  Many priests and teachers of the law used this gate to go in and out of the temple. As they approached the gate, Peter and John saw people carrying a man to the temple. He was unable to make the journey alone because both his legs had been crippled from birth. People helped him to the temple gate so that he could beg there. At that time the Jews regarded charity as a good virtue. People thought that they would be rewarded by God if they gave money to a beggar when they entered the temple so this was a prime begging spot. 
 
The primary concern of the crippled man in this passage was to sort out his daily need through begging. Because of his physical problem this man expected nothing more than a few pennies, he was understandably fatalistic, he believed that his life would never change, that he would be a crippled beggar his whole life. Many who passed by him knew who God was yet when they saw the crippled man they did not stop to help him spiritually, instead they were just relieved that their lives were not as bad as his. This shows us that those people who passed him by were also spiritually crippled, they did not have the power or heart to help one man. We can also live like spiritual cripples. The deep rooted fatalism that effected the crippled man can also effect us. Particularly when it comes to out reach and disciple making. We can begin to think that it is impossible, that we can do nothing to change the students. But we need to challenge this thinking by faith in Jesus' name. If we do not experience the power of the name of Jesus, although we believe in Jesus we are spiritually crippled.

On that day the crippled man was showing his useless legs and asking for money, he begged for money from Peter and John as they were about to enter the temple. 'Have mercy on me, give me 20p and you will be blessed by God' Look at verse 4 'Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, "Look at us!" It is uncomfortable looking directly at a beggar, it is far easier to simply walk by or to drop money at his feet without looking at him. But Peter and John looked strait at him and told the beggar 'Look at us' Why did they do this? It was because they wanted to help him by the power of Jesus' name. However, in order to help him spiritually like this they first needed to have a personal relationship with him. Peter looked at him eye to eye with the heart of a shepherd and prepared him to receive Jesus' grace. The beggar may have been shocked buy Peters words. No one ever wanted to look at him, he perhaps expected to get notes rather than coins, so the man gave them his attention.

Yet what does Peter say? Look at verse 6. 'Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk."' Peter had built up this man's expectation but now says 'Silver or gold I do not have', which means 'I have no money'. This could be disappointing to the beggar. But Peter continued, 'What I have I give you'. When we help people, we can be disappointed at our weaknesses, we can think that we lack intellect, language or think that we are too old or out of touch to help young people. However, like the apostles, though we may not have silver or gold we have Jesus Christ. Those who have Jesus have everything because all the treasures are hidden in him. Hence we can totally and fundamentally help others with Jesus. Humanly we may be lacking but we must have absolute confidence in Jesus. 

When Peter said "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you.', the beggar might have sensed that he would receive something important. He might have begun to have a hope that his fundamental problem would be solved. Peter says, 'In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.' He was over forty years old (4:22). He never walked in his entire life. Yet Peter boldly told to him to walk in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. To the Jews, 'Nazareth' was a despised word. But Peter believed that Jesus who had grown up in Nazareth is the Messiah, who rose from the dead, ascended into heaven, holds the authority of heaven and earth and has the power to heal the crippled man.

What does it mean that Peter said 'walk in the name of Jesus Christ'? It reveals Peter had absolute faith in the risen Jesus. In the past Peter had relied on his own strength and power and failed. Yet his attitude changed after he met the risen Jesus. He believed that Jesus is almighty God. He believed that nothing's impossible if he relied on Jesus. His faith was living and practical. He commanded the beggar who had never walked, 'In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.'

Peter then helped the beggar to have faith. Look at verse 7. 'Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong.' The beggar held Peter's hand and, by faith, he believed that what Peter had said would happen, he came to have faith in the power of Jesus. Slowly and gradually he stood up on his feet. He began to walk and jumped with great excitement. He went into the temple courts, praising God. He had expected couple of coins yet he came to experience the power of Jesus Christ. It was great work of God.

What does this miracle show? Firstly, it testifies to the truth of Jesus' resurrection and ascension. Peter commanded the man to walk in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Through this the living power of Jesus was revealed to him. Jesus is alive and has the power to totally change one man. Secondly, life changing miracles happen through faith in Jesus. Jesus sees the faith of each person and heals them according to their faith. Faith in Jesus Christ is followed by supernatural power that completely changes one person. Thirdly, Jesus' healing has the power to solve our root problem. People superficially helped this crippled man with a couple of coins but Jesus dealt with his fundamental problem. Jesus' healing happens from within. There is true freedom from our suffering in Christ. Fourthly, those who are weak in faith can be helped by others' faith. Someone may not have the faith to help himself but as we grow in faith we can help them. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.(James 5:15-16)

The miracle in this passage is an outstanding miracle of the Holy Spirit in the early church. We do not see miracles like this today, Yet that is not to say God is working less powerfully, he is simply working differently. Today we see the great miracle of one person's changed life. The miracle of a crippled man had a huge impact on people around him. In the same way when one man is changed by the grace of Jesus it has the same effect. Families and friends are astonished. Stanley Kaier was so amazed by the powerful change of one cynical lawyer ' Paul Ridge, that he made a decision to teach the Bible one to one, the result of that was James and Darren coming to faith, and then through James came Simon. The miracle of one changed life has a powerful ripple effect.

Look at verse 11. 'While the beggar held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's Colonnade.' The beggar held on to Peter and John. He wanted to show everyone that he was healed by these men and express his gratitude to the apostles. All the people came running in the place called Solomon's Colonnade. At that time Peter did not perform another miracle instead he began to testify to Jesus. A miracle is like an alarm bell that draws people towards Jesus. The purpose of a miracle is to testify to Jesus.

Look at verse 12. 'When Peter saw this, he said to them: "Men of Israel, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?' Peter was quick to divert the attention away from himself towards Jesus. This was a dangerous time, while being lifted up by people Peter could take the glory for himself. But we see that he was entirely God centred and Christ centred. He humbled himself and lifted up Christ. People are fascinated by miracles like healing. But Peter turns their attention to Jesus.

The God of the Jews was the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The Jews were proud of there ancestry. Peter declared that the God of their fathers had glorified his servant Jesus. Yet what had they done to Jesus? Look at verses 14,15. 'You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you. You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this.' The Jews handed Jesus over to Pilate. He couldn't find any wrongdoing in Jesus and decided to release him. Yet they asked him to release Barabbas and crucify Jesus. In this way they killed the author of life. 'The author of life' means 'one who is sovereign over life' or 'the giver of life'. It refers to the Creator and ultimately Christ who is life. (Jn 1:4) The word 'you' is emphasised.  Peter points directly to their sin in order to convict them and bring them to repentance. Yet what did God do for Jesus? He raised him from the dead. Through this God revealed that Jesus is the Son of God, the Holy One. The apostles are witnesses of this. They can testify that Jesus has risen and that the power of the risen Jesus healed this man. 

Look at verse 16. 'By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has given this complete healing to him, as you can all see.' Peter repeats that it was not their own ability that healed the man but Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him. It was Jesus who was risen that had healed the man. But how was the power of Jesus revealed? It was through faith. Peter and John's faith was crucial but the crippled man also had faith. He did not reject what Peter commanded but got to his feet believing that Jesus could heal him, then he praised God. Jesus' power was revealed through the pipe line of faith and healed a crippled man. 

Look at verse 17. "Now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.' After fiercely pointing out their sin Peter gently says to them 'brothers.' He says that their ignorance caused them to sin. Peter goes on to explains that Jesus' crucifixion was fulfilment of God's promise. This however did not release them from the burden of sin, whether done in ignorance or deliberate fault sin is sin. So Peter gives them the solution. Look at verse 19. 'Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,' What they need to do now is repent. They should find their sin deeply and ask God for the forgiveness. Then merciful God will forgive them and times of refreshing may come. Repentance is never easy, finding ones sin is painful yet the result is times of refreshing come to us. Only repentance and Jesus' grace brings us true inner peace. Peter then goes on to say that when all men repent the door is opened up for Jesus to come again, this is the ultimate goal of salvation work, bringing forward the time of Jesus' second coming. 

Look at verse 24."Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken, have foretold these days.' Jesus is the very Messiah whom Moses and all the prophets had prophesied. All the regulations and rules in the Old Testament prophesied about the coming Messiah. True prophet, true priest, true king, true servant, true offering, temple, Passover lamb, true circumcision, bread, shepherd, Zion, Jerusalem etc Christ is the shadow of everything. The Old Testament is prophecy about the Christ and Jesus is the fulfilment. He came to bless those who are spiritually crippled so that they may walk freely and praise God.

In conclusion, the risen Jesus is working amongst us right now. He works through faith. He reveals his almighty power through those who believe. He doesn't improve one's condition temporally but solves man's fundamental problem. Only the power of Jesus Christ solves man's root problem. May we firmly believe in the power of the risen Jesus and challenge people's inner problems by faith in Jesus' name.
