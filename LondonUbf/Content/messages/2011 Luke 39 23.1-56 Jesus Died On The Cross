JESUS DIED ON THE CROSS

Luke 23:1-56
Key verse 23:33 �When they came to the place of the skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals�one on his right, the other on his left.� 

Everything living has to die. The Bible teaches us that all men must die because of sin. Yet there is death that is unique in history and that is the death of Jesus Christ. What is the meaning of Jesus� death to us? May God open our spiritual eyes to understand and accept the meaning of the cross.

Jesus was betrayed by his disciple Judas Iscariot. He was tried throughout the night by the religious leaders. The religious leaders condemned him to death. They handed him over to Pilate, the Roman governor because they had no legal right to execute Jesus. Pilate examined him but did not find any basis for a charge against him. Herod also tried Jesus hoping that he would perform some miracle, but was disappointed and returned him to Pilate. Pilate told the religious leaders and the people that he would just punish and release him. Then the crowd cried out in one voice, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!" (18) Pilate hesitated. He wanted to release Jesus. But the crowd kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" With loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified. Pilate's effort to release him did not work. The shouts of the crowd prevailed. Pilate caved in to their demand. (24)

I want at this point to go straight to verse 33 and begin to ask the question why is Jesus� death so unique and so important for each person to understand. Let�s read verse 33. �When they came to the place of the skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals�one on his right, the other on his left.� Luke is very brief in his description of the crucifixion, just four words, three in Greek, there they crucified him. It was a form of death by torture that was so shocking, and horrific that when Mel Gibson represented it on film it was given an 18 certificate, the same as is given to torture porn movies. The Gibson film might have been over the top, we can get desensitized when watching film, but the amount Jesus suffered is important to understand. There have been many historical and scientific studies on crucifixion. John Macarthur points us to one concise article was published March 21, 1986 in JAMA Journal of the American Medical Association:
The study included the fact that everyone who was crucified was beaten before crucifixion.  This was always done.  Braided leather thongs with bits of metal and sheep bone or some other kind of animal bone embedded in them were used to lash the victim from the bottom of the neck all the way down to the back of the knees.  At the time that he was being lashed, his arms were extended up and tied to a pole, he was in a slumped position.  Two lifters hit him with alternating blows.  We don�t know whether or not they followed the Jewish prescription of no more than 40 lashes.  We don�t know how many lashes these people received.  There�s no indication.  But all the results would be that the bone and the metal rip into the flesh, deep contusions, and circulatory shock would ensue. 
Maybe Jesus had some exacerbated agonies because it is said of Jesus that when they took Him back into the Judgment Hall after this, they put a robe on Him.  It would be a crusty old robe made of wool that would do nothing but agitate and irritate His open wounds.  And then they jabbed a crown of thorns on His head, hit Him in the head with a stick and spit on Him.  And at some point, they ripped the robe back off Him which would again agitate and rip the wounds.  There would be intense pain, blood loss, making the skin hyper-sensitive.  Add to that lack of sleep, lack of food, lack of water.  And after all of that, then came crucifixion. 
The Romans didn�t invent it, but they did perfect it.  It was a slow death with maximum agony.  The victims carried the cross, perhaps the crosspiece, across the back of their necks and their shoulders and their arms were tied to it. Jesus received help because apparently He wasn�t moving fast enough or some other motivation.  And so, Simon of Cyrene was asked to carry His cross and either he took the piece off the shoulders of Jesus and carried it for Him, or Jesus was actually carrying His whole cross and Simon picked up the bottom of it that was banging along the cobblestones because Luke says he carried it behind him. 
Arriving at the place of crucifixion, they would be offered that sedation which Jesus refused and they would be thrown to the ground on their backs.  The crosspiece 
would then be pulled under their shoulders and their arms were nailed to the cross piece.  The Romans used nails.  Archaeologists have found the remains of crucified victims from as early as the first century and earlier.  And the nails were tapered iron spikes five to seven inches long, about half inch in diameter square.  They were driven through the wrists, right here, rather than the palms of the hands so they could carry the full weight of the slumping body. 
And so, lying on His back on the ground, each of these three would be nailed to the crosspiece with these great square spikes driven through each wrist.  The impaled victim was then lifted up, the crosspiece was attached to the horizontal, often called the stipies(?).  The feet were then nailed, the knees bent up.  The feet were nailed with one nail, one foot upon the other so that the victim could push up to breathe, to inhale and exhale and pull up on the wounds to do the same.  And whether pulling with the wrist or pushing with the feet, they would be pulling and pushing against the wound. 
The slumping condition and the bent knees was so severe that you couldn�t breathe in that position.  The soldiers could bring death in minutes by breaking the legs.  The broke the legs and the victim couldn�t push up, he would die in minutes because he couldn�t breathe.  To survive, the victim would push up and pull up on the wounds.  
To confirm death, the body was pierced with a lance and it was pierced in precisely the exact spot in the heart in which the flow of blood and water, as it�s described in the Bible, would come out to indicate death.  All Roman soldiers were taught the most precise place in a human anatomy to put your lance.  Each effort of the person on the cross to breathe would mean he had to pull himself up or push himself up which would then rub the open wounds up the course of the rugged cross and then back down again, ripping and shredding those wounds further.  The nails in the wrist would crush or sever the long sensory rhy-motor median nerve, and when a nerve is damaged and a nerve is pierced, the bolts of pain are relentless.  The nails in the feet would likely pierce the deep paraneil nerve, planter nerves, the same results.  So you would have vicious relentless nerve pain through your feet, through your hands. 
The weight of the body pulling against all these agonizing torturous bolts of pain, struggles, pulling itself up, pushing itself up, breathing is shallow, you don�t get enough oxygen, what do you get? contractions, muscle cramps, add to that dehydration, congestive heart failure, plural effusions.  One can�t even comprehend how painful all of it is.  There�s a word for it, excruciating. It comes from Latin excrucia, out of the cross.
That was a long description, but I believe it is necessary to understand how much Jesus suffered as a part of understanding his love and the meaning of his death. However, Luke is much briefer and this was not to spare the reader from gruesome details. Simply, there was no need to describe something that was so familiar to people in 1st Century AD. Crucifixion was common place. They estimate that during Jesus� life time, the Romans crucified 30,000 people in Israel. By then, it had been used for about 500 years, it is thought to have been invented by the Persians, Darius is recorded crucifying 3,000 Babylonians. Later when Jerusalem was sacked by the Romans in 70 AD historians say that Titus crucified so many Jews that they ran out of wood. Therefore the uniqueness of Jesus� death is not that Jesus was crucified, verse 33 tells us he was crucified between two criminals.
So what is it that makes Jesus� death unique and the most important truth for any person to understand? Let�s read verse 33 again, �When they came to the place of the skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals�one on his right, the other on his left.� I want to draw out four reasons for the uniqueness and importance for Jesus death
 First, Jesus was crucified along with the criminals
Jesus was not crucified alone, in a way that would honour him or give him a noble death. Rather the Romans made sure he was in the middle of two criminals, emphasising he was to be treated no differently. It was an intentional disgrace. We don�t know what crimes they were guilty of, they might well have been henchmen of Barabbas, who were not released. But what is certain is that they were guilty by their own admission, verse 41 says �We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.� Jesus is there numbered amongst the transgressors. This is an image of God incarnate. Just as Jesus gave up his glory in heaven to be with us first as a baby in the manger amongst the filth of the stable, then later as he ate with tax collectors and sinners and now he is crucified between them. Whenever someone sins, they feel shame, Adam and Eve hid from God in he garden, they felt exposed. Part of the purpose of crucifixion is to expose people in public, to shame them to lift them high in their nakedness and agony. We might feel the same way when in our sinfulness we come before the Holy God, our sin exposed and shouted from the roof tops. Such sin separates us from God, we cannot stand in his presence. Yet Jesus came to be with us, in the middle of our sin and filth, he hung next to us in our disgrace, as our priest, intercessor and friend. Ultimately he will clothe our nakedness in his righteousness.
Second, He was punished in our place
The criminal declared �this man has done nothing wrong.� This echoes Pilate�s judgement, �I find no basis for a charge against this man.� Yet Jesus was punished. The cross, in all its agony, is God�s wrath upon Jesus for the sin of the world. It is often said that no one would sin if they knew what the punishment for sin is. No one sin if they fully understood the seriousness of God�s awaiting wrath. Jesus had earlier said to the women weeping for him in verse 28, �Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children. For the time is coming when you will say. �Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!� Jesus did not want them to be sentimental about his death, instead he warned them about the coming destruction of Jerusalem, which is just a prelude to the real judgement God will meet out on all unrepentant sinners. The massacre in Jerusalem was so merciless, so horrific. God�s wrath is terrible. And yet what Jesus was going through on the cross was God�s just solution to our sin that needs paying for. Isaiah 53:5 says �He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.� Jesus does not want us to feel sorry or sentimental about his death, he wants us to understand why he was willingly going to the cross, that we might sincerely repent and accept his payment for our sin.
Third, He prayed for our forgiveness on the cross
Look at verse 34. �Jesus said, �Father forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.� The reason to try and meditate on the suffering of Jesus is to understand how hard it must have been for him to say this prayer on our behalf. Jesus had come to be with us, to teach us God�s love and truth, to serve and heal and restore. Yet he was repaid with the most horrific, brutal and unjust treatment. He had every right to call down curses and God�s wrath upon us, it would be totally reasonable to become full of bitterness and resentment yet instead he prayed �Father forgive them.�
One of the most serious problems of sinful human nature is that we find it so difficult to forgive others. Because of not being able to forgive, conflicts arise between nations and people. If people could forgive others just a little, many problems would be solved. But in reality, forgiving others is so difficult. How can we forgive those who hurt us, those who humiliated and damaged us? How can we forgive those who returned evil for good? In our own strength we can�t. We cannot forgive those who abused us, or ill-treated us. We cannot forgive our enemies. But before we think of those whom we cannot forgive, we must think of Jesus who forgave us. Who were we? We were all like those who crucified Jesus. We need to hear his prayer for us �Father forgive them.� 
Fourth, Jesus prayed for our ignorance
 A consistent theme that runs throughout this chapter is the amount of mocking that goes on. We see it with Herod whose soldiers ridicule him, dressing him in an elegant robe, we see it in the people in verse 35 who stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, �He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of god, the Chosen one.� In verse 36 we see the soldiers who �also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar and said, �If you are the king of the Jews save yourself.� Being men of power they respected force, not what they saw as passive surrender. Even the sign above Jesus� head was a mockery, �This is the king of the Jews.� To mock someone supposes they know better. Everyone there, Pilate, the religious leaders the soldiers and the people thought they knew what was going on, they thought they were triumphing over someone who had failed. Yet in every respect, even in their mockery, they revealed their ignorance and the triumph of God�s sovereign salvation plan. 
We have already heard from Isaiah, but Ps 22 that describes so well Jesus� crucifixion also prophesies the mockery. Verse 7, 8 read �All who see me mock me, they hurl insults, shaking their heads: He trusts in the Lord; let the Lord deliver him, since he delights in him.� Verse 16 reads �Dogs have surrounded a band of evil men has encircled me, they Have pierced my hands and feet. I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me. They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.� In their mockery and ridicule they were fulfilling the word of God to the letter. Jesus was not a victim, he had intentionally given the Sanhedrin what they wanted, he had intentionally gone to the cross, laying down his life. The people�s mockery was not cleverness, it wasn�t triumph, it was ignorance and Jesus prayed for them. �Father forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.� Since the cross Christianity has been a faith that has been mocked; it was a stumbling block for Jews and foolishness to the gentiles (1Co 1:23) and continues to be. If we are to follow Jesus, we will be mocked by colleagues, friends and most certainly intellectual UCL students. At such a time we need to remember Jesus� prayer and that Jesus uses the foolish to shame the wise (1Co 1:227). We also need to understand how our own sin of pride, lust, and complacency can also blind us and pray for the Holy Spirit�s conviction.
From verse 40 to to the end of this chapter Luke mentions a few individuals who did not mock Jesus, who were not ignorant, but saw Jesus Christ as God. There is the criminal who knew that Jesus was innocent. He feared God and repented. He is sometimes known as the Abraham of the New Testament believing that Jesus would rise again and go to the kingdom of God. He prayed, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom." He had probably heard Jesus� prayer and his heart melted. He came to believe that Jesus was the messiah to come. Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise. There is the centurion who had seen many men die in his life but no one like Jesus. In verse 47 he saw what had happened, praised God and said, �Surely this was a righteous man.� Then there are the women and all those who knew him watching from a distance. Finally there is Joseph of Arimathea who buried Jesus in his own tomb.
In conclusion, even though Jesus was the Son of God he was flogged and crucified because of us. He was punished and forsaken by all men because of our sin. On the cross, Jesus did not condemn us. He prayed to God to forgive us. When we look up at the cross of Jesus, we realise how serious the consequence of our sin is. We also realise how great the love of God is for sinners like us. When we look at the cross of Jesus, our pain from sin disappears and we receive forgiveness. We give up our desire to enjoy the pleasures of sin. We come to have the desire to live a holy life and save others from their sin. Praise Jesus who died on the cross for our sin! Amen!
