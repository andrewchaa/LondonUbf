2011 Luke 29

THE SON OF MAN WILL COME LIKE LIGHTNING

Luke 17:20-37
Key verse 17:24
�For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightening, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.�

Today�s passage starts a section of teaching by Jesus about the Kingdom of God. Jesus first message was �the Kingdom of God is near; repent and believe the good news�. What did Jesus mean by the Kingdom of God? Where is it? How will it come? How should we prepare and how do we enter? These questions are answered in the remainder of Chapter 17 and much of Chapter 18. Through studying this passage, may the kingdom of God be realised in our hearts. May God help us not to be bound by this world but put our hope firmly in his kingdom. 

I. The kingdom of God is within you (20,21)

Look at verse 20a; �Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come�. The Pharisees asked Jesus when the kingdom of God would come. Normally the Pharisees ask Jesus a question to trap him but this is a fair question and one that was being asked by many around this time. They thought it would be like the kingdom of David. This was an understandable conclusion. The Old Testament contains the hope of a coming king and one who would rule and establish God�s nation. And in particular the inter-testament history between the Old and New Testament era is relevant to this common idea.  Before Rome it was the Seleucid Empire that reigned over Israel. In about 167 B.C a man named Judas Maccabeus, a Jew whose nickname was �The Hammer,� led a revolt against the Seleucid Empire.  From this revolt they gained independence from and Israel was once again its own empire. But for only about 25 years. After this they were occupied by Rome.  So Judas Maccabeus is fresh in their minds and they hope for someone like Judas Maccabeus to come in as the �Hammer part II� and destroy Rome.  

Deep in us is a hope that God�s kingdom will come and like the Pharisees we wonder, �When is this going to get here?  When will all this mess be sorted out? When will I find purpose?  When will I find meaning? When will my life get easier?� That�s what this question is.  How Jesus does answer this? Look at verses 20b-21: �Jesus replied, �The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, nor will people say, �Here it is,� or �There it is,� because the kingdom of God is within you.�  

First, Jesus corrected the Pharisees misconception. Jesus said, �The kingdom of God won�t come with your careful observation, nor will people say, �Here it is� or �There it is.�� The Greek word for careful observation literally refers to what a person can see. When Nicodemus, a Pharisee, heard Jesus� encouragement to be born again in order to see the kingdom of God, he asked �How can a man be born when he is old? Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother�s womb to be born!� Nicodemus took Jesus� words �you must be born again� to be about the physical world, the world he could see. Jesus, however, was speaking about the work of the Holy Spirit.  Likewise the Pharisees were looking for a physical kingdom and a physical saviour, something or someone they could point to and say, �here it is� or �there it is�. Such a kingdom would be tangible and easy to believe in. It also would require no change of heart. This is not only the Pharisees� misconception, but also can be our fixed idea. We ask for Jesus and his kingdom to come. We want our lives to get better and things to improve. We wait hoping things will get easier, more comfortable and better. We want to point to the Kingdom and say �here it is in my family, my home, my church, my job�. In such things we wish that God would come and change the world around us but without necessarily changing us.

Strangely I have seen recently the reverse where outwardly things got worse but God�s kingdom came. At work the head of our accounts was a man called John. A few years ago we spoke briefly about faith. He was not so interested and I started to pray for him for a while. What happened? His life became terrible. His mother got very sick. He had to stop work and care for her. Over almost a year and a half she got worse and worse and finally died. He became unable to work and even lost his job. Yet I spoke to him last week and found that through all this he has come to faith and now attends church faithfully. Physically there was no sign or improvement to live but rather there had been a radical inner change.

Jesus kingdom does not start with a change in our circumstances; it starts with a change in our hearts. Jesus� first message on earth was, �The time has come. The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!� (Mk 1:15) In order to have the kingdom of God we must repent and believe the good news. In order to retain the kingdom of God in our hearts we must continue to repent and accept Jesus as our Lord. Nowadays, some are interested in miracles; some focus on gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as the power of healing or speaking in tongues. Some focus on prophecy and seek to calculate the year and date of Jesus� second coming as we have recently seen with Harold Camping who wrongly predicted Jesus would come on 21 May 2011. He is now saying it will be 21 October. Yet the kingdom comes within when we repent and believe. It�s realised in our hearts. 

II. Jesus will come like the lightning (22-25)

Having responded to the Pharisees Jesus then turned to his disciples to correct their misunderstanding about the coming kingdom. Look at verses 22-23. �Then he said to his disciples, �The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. Men will tell you, �There he is!� or �Here he is!� Do not go running off after them.� Jesus� disciples had already received Jesus as Lord in their hearts. They were waiting for the coming of God�s kingdom by faith. And there would come a time, whether because of fierce persecution or painful wounds from their spiritual struggle, when they would long for its coming and so be liberated from their suffering. But Jesus said, �you will not see it.� The disciples also had a misconception about God�s kingdom. They would long to see the Kingdom but as verse 22 makes clear they will not see it. Rather they would have to wait patiently for the kingdom to come. Why? Because God is patient and wants everyone to repent and come to a knowledge of the truth. Although the disciples may believe there were many who had not yet come into the kingdom. If Jesus had come a few years ago my friend John would not be in the Kingdom. God is working to bring many more in. He is patient. 

When will the Kingdom finally come? Look at verse 24, �For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.� Jesus will come in his day and at the right time. Lightning strikes suddenly and unexpectedly. It comes from above and is visible to everyone. This week we have had storms and heavy rain � it was if someone turned a hose on and off it came so quickly. No one needed to hear from someone else that a rainstorm had come. We all experienced it for ourselves. Likewise when Jesus comes again we will not hear about it from others, we will all see it for ourselves at once. It will be a universal event. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 says, "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever." Jesus' coming will shake the world and raise the dead. It will usher in a new heaven and new earth. Jesus will wipe away every tear and bring in a glorious new kingdom. This is our Christian hope.

Although the kingdom starts as an invisible transformation through personal faith in Christ as Lord, it does not end in that way. In the end, the kingdom will be visible like the light of a lightning flash from one end of the sky to the other. In short, the kingdom begins in individuals, but its purpose is the transformation of the world. This is a great hope! So why doesn�t Jesus just get a move on? Some may say �OK Jesus we really want this kingdom � it sounds great. If you really are the king that you say you are, let�s see your kingdom?� It�s a fair point. What does Jesus say?

Look at verse 25. �But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.� Before the kingdom comes the cross. Jesus is saying, �You can�t just have the kingdom, you need to go through the cross.� You can�t just have a better world; we have to deal with sin. And once he deals with sin, it opens and unveils the opportunity of the coming of the kingdom. Only after the gospel is completed through his death and resurrection, and after the gospel is preached to all nations, will Jesus come with power and with great glory. (Mk 13:10). First he must suffer. Likewise with us.   

III. At the end of the age (26-37)

So here�s the question for us, will we enter Jesus� kingdom or be condemned? When Jesus returns, will we be ready to meet him? Will you be a citizen of his kingdom and loyal to him as king or not? And so Jesus gives us two examples from history of people who had an invitation to be citizens of his kingdom. One was a positive example and the other negative

First the positive example of Noah. Look at verses 26-27. �Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.� Jesus uses Noah as a positive example to understand that what happened in the days of Noah is going to happen again in the end. Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. The account of Noah is well known. Noah lived in the desert and was told by God to build a huge boat. It�s more the size of a battleship and was to be about 1.4 million cubic feet. It would take Noah a long time to build this thing as well as all his money and time. And all the while as Peter tells us Noah was warning people of what was to come. He was a preacher of righteousness (2 Pe 2:5). Yet no one seriously listened or considered the message of judgment. No one paid any attention to the warning. The people no doubt laughed at him. He was probably a tourist attraction. When visiting the town people would say �do you want to see the boat guy?� He was a laughing stock. Yet every day in faith Noah got up and built the boat as God had commanded. He warned people of the judgment to come and urged people to repent and trust in him and get into the boat. Nobody believed him. Instead they spent time in eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage. In short people just got on with ordinary life and forgot about God. Until one day we read of some of the most haunting words in the bible from Genesis 7:16 � then the Lord shut them in. The chance to get into the boat was lost. The rains poured down and everyone died. The chance to get into the boat was gone and they drowned. Today the door is open. Today the ark is Jesus Christ. Today we can come to Jesus. Today we can be saved from the coming wrath. People say �I�m not interested. I don�t think judgment is coming.� But one day this door will close. It�s a chilling thought to think of the regret on the day of the flood: People banging on the ark to get in; desperate to avoid the coming flood but all died. 

The second example is more negative and deals with the danger that believers can fall into. We read of the days of Lot and in particular Lot�s wife. Verses 28-29: �It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulphur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.� In verse 32 Jesus tells us �Remember Lot�s wife�. The people in Lot�s time were corrupt in the sight of God. They were notorious for sin and rejection of God. From Genesis 19 we read of their corruption, particularly sexual corruption. Yet just as in the days of Noah, Jesus emphasizes how ordinary life would appear as people spent time worrying about their meals, thinking about shopping and their jobs. In short they thought of their own lives and gave no thought to God. But God has mercy on Lot and his family because of the prayer of his uncle Abraham. In the nick of time God sends two angels to rescue Lot and his family from the city. This was incredible grace as Lot was hardly a model believer. He and his family are not good missionary candidates! The angel warned her through Lot, �Flee for your lives! Don�t look back, and don�t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!� God rained down burning sulphur on Sodom and Gomorrah from the heavens. God destroyed all those living in the cities and the nearby plain. But while she was running for her life, Lot�s wife turned and became a pillar of salt. (Ge 19:26) Lot�s wife knew that she should not look back. But through her attachment to her worldly possessions, she looked back. This tells us about her value system.

This is a warning from Jesus. Lot�s wife came so close to be saved; she was shown mercy yet despite all this failed to enter the Kingdom of God. Even though she believed in God, she loved worldly possessions more than God. She looked back, longed back and in her heart went back.

And what about us? Are we like that? Is God is trying to deliver from a life of sin but in your heart, you miss your sin. You miss your old days and your old ways. You look back and maybe turn back. We can go back and do things we should not be doing, believe things we should not be believe; condone things that you should be condemning. If so, Jesus says, �Remember Lot�s wife.� 

Jesus summary is in verse 33. �Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.� Mark 8:35 says, �For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.� What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? The way to preserve our lives is to lose them for Jesus and for his gospel.

When we think of Lot�s wife, we learn how we should live in this world as believers. We were born into this world empty handed, and at some point, we have to leave this world empty handed. If we are bound by this world we cannot bear God�s grace of salvation. Even though we use worldly possessions we must be careful that we are not bound by them. 

In conclusion, Jesus is the king and on his return the Kingdom of God will be established. When he comes he will come like the lightning and we will all see him. The final day will come at a time no one expects. Are you ready? We should remember Lot�s wife and not be bound by the things in the world. May God help us to retain our salvation until the day our Lord comes again and warn others of God�s holy judgment.
