2011 Luke 13

WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

Luke 8:22-39
Key Verse 8:30
Jesus asked him, �What is your name?� �Legion,� he replied, because many demons had gone into him. 

In last week�s passage, Jesus planted great hope and vision in his disciples by giving them the parable of the sower. Those who hear, retain and persevere with his words can produce a crop a hundred fold. Through today�s passage, through two events Jesus helps us to learn more about who he is. By calming the squall and healing a demon-possessed man we learn about the person and the power of Jesus Christ: that this Jesus is Almighty God who has power and authority over both creation and the spiritual world. May God help us to learn Jesus� authority and love through this passage.
       
I.  Jesus Calms the Storm (22-25)  
Look at verse 22. �One day Jesus said to his disciples, �Let�s go over to the other side of the lake.� So they got into a boat and set out.� Jesus said to his disciples � let�s go to the other side of the lake. This was his initiative, perhaps he wanted to spend more time with his disciples and to give them some rest. Remember, this in the context of Jesus going from one town and village to another teaching and preaching and healing huge crowds of people.  It was physically demanding work, and we see how tired he when he just falls asleep in the boat. We can imagine the disciples were also really happy to get away and spend some personal time with Jesus, so they got into a boat and set out. 

Look at verse 23, �As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.�  A while ago they discovered the 2,000 year old remains of a boat in Israel of the kind that Jesus and his disciples would have used. What is striking is that it wasn�t that big for thirteen men to sit in. They might have begun by rowing, Luke mentions they were sailing, so there was probably also a sail, but it would have been cramped. Lake Galilee is big, about 8 miles wide and thirteen miles long, that�s why they call it a sea. All of a sudden, a squall came down on the lake. A squall is a wind storm, It is particularly dangerous because you don�t see them coming, particularly at night which is when they had set out (Mk 4:35). It says they were in great danger, they were being swamped which means more water was coming in than they were able to bail out. There is a tipping point when the boat would simply sink, very fast, and even if a few of them could swim, in such severe weather conditions, they wouldn�t have been able to cover miles, without life jackets in the freezing cold. They tried their best to get the water out but they couldn�t it was out of their control. 

Look at verse 24.� They went and woke him saying, �Master, Master, we�re going to drown.� He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided and all was calm.� In this verse we see two aspects of Jesus, which reveals to us two things about him. First, his sleeping reveals Jesus very much as a man. Luke describes the waters as �raging�, the waves were furious, the sea was angry-- yet it seems Jesus was in a deep sleep. Here we see the extent of Jesus� tiredness. Jesus wasn�t some kind of super man who was physically invulnerable and didn�t need sleep. He came to be with us as a man, experiencing all the vulnerability and limitations of his physical body. He worked hard and he slept where he could, even in this cramped boat. We also see in the midst of a storm his peace. 

Second we see Jesus as God. �He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided and all was calm.� It�s an interesting choice of words, Jesus rebuked the wind. In order for a rebuke to be effective one�s words need authority. That�s why none of us bother trying to rebuke the weather, we know our words have no weight over nature. But here Jesus reveals the awesome power of his words. Jesus says and it is so, Jesus says let there be, and it was. Weather and the forces of nature are so immense, the natural elements so vast, we have seen a glimpse of them in the tsunami of the last week. Yet here, when his disciples cried out for help Jesus calmed the squall, only God can do this. Ps 89:9 says �You rule over the surging sea; when its waves mount up, you still them.� Jesus is Almighty God who controls and rules over the earth and all creation. 

Look at verse 25. �Where is your faith?� He asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, �Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.� Jesus asked this question to his terrified disciples. We might think their reaction was understandable, their fear justified as they were in great danger. They were so certain they were going to drown, and the reality of death stung them with fear. But Jesus question suggested he wanted more from them than just helpless fear. He wanted them to have faith in him. This question where is your faith is addressed to every believer. In life there are storms. The disciples, even though they travelled in the same boat as Jesus, were not spared the terrifying experience of this storm. Life storms reveal our spiritual reality in a way no amount of theoretical learning is able to. In the parable of the sower, Jesus had been teaching about the time of testing. May be the disciples had nodded profoundly, but the storm made such a time of testing a reality. 

In a Sunday message we can talk about storms in theory, but whenever we face a storm, we are tempted to ask why is this happening? We are tempted to complain, and grumble and mistakenly feel that because we are Christians we should be spared such suffering. But in the question �Where is your faith?� we also find Jesus gives us an answer. It is in the storm we learn faith. Jesus is asking �Do you trust me, do you know who I am? Do you know what I am able to do?� Storms can manifest in different ways, through temptation, accidents, persecution, or ill health, in a way that threatens our very existence. Often they happen when we are tired or at our limit. What do we do when a storm hits us? The disciples had waited until they were almost swamped. They had exhausted all their options, they had struggled in their own strength for a solution and only when they were certain of death did they come panicking to Jesus. Jesus asked his disciples �Where is your faith?� not because they came to him, but because they had waited until the last minute-- until they were panicking, to come to him. He asked them �Where is your faith?� not because they came to him, but because they came to him in fear and panic, not trusting or understanding his Almighty power to calm the storm. How are we coming to Jesus? Are we waiting until we are swamped, only when we are really desperate? Or do we come to Jesus first in prayer and praise, trusting in his Almighty power to calm the storm? 

�In fear and amazement, disciples asked one another � who is this? He commands even the wind and the water, and they obey him.� Their spiritual eyes were opened to the fact that Jesus is Almighty. They saw his divine nature as the creator God in Jesus. Later on, based on this faith, the disciples were able to overcome all the difficulties in the early church and became great men of faith. What kind of attitude do we have in our journey of life? Are we afraid of the squall and grumbling? Then, we need to listen to Jesus question � where is your faith? 

?. What is your name? (26-39)

Look at verse 26 and 27a. �They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee. When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town.� Jesus and his disciples arrived in the land of Gerasenes. This was a pagan region. Alexander the great had established 10 cities here known as the Decapolis and now in Jesus� day a Legion was stationed here. The pig industry was a profitable business for such gentiles but totally unclean and against the scriptures of the Old Testament. The disciples must have been exhausted after their experience and would have wanted a time of calm and peaceful rest. Now, however, upon their arrival, a demon-possessed man came out of the tomb and welcomed them. How was he like? Look at verse 27b. �For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.� He did not wear clothes � this means that he didn�t want to follow the norm of the society and lived a rebellious life. He also lived in the tomb instead of a house. This shows that perhaps his relationship with his family had broken down. The fact that he lived in the tombs also suggests that he didn�t want to have any relationship with anybody and wanted to live on his own without any care or concern. What was his reality? Mark�s gospel tells us that he self-harmed, cutting his body and crying day and night. He could not find any rest or freedom in the tomb. He was able to free himself from people�s sight. However, he was firmly bound by the power of darkness. 

Jesus came and saw this man. What was this man�s reaction to Jesus? Look verse 28.  �When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, �What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don�t torture me!� On the one hand, he really wanted to have a relationship with Jesus and to be saved but on the other when he approached Jesus he violently reacted against him. Why were his reactions like this? Look at verse 29. �For Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.� Jesus when he saw him suffering between the tomb � shouting and torturing himself, he knew why he was like this. He knew that behind this there are evil demons who control this man. 

Here we should understand clearly about the reality of demons. Just as the Bible reveals the reality of Satan so it speaks of demons, fallen angels and evil spirits who are with him. (Isa 14, Ez 28). In our contemporary world people don�t like acknowledging the existence of demons, it seems somehow not intelligent or sophisticated, primitive even as if such talk belongs to a medieval world. But that is just how the devil likes it. The most important principle when fighting a spiritual battle is to know your enemy. Paul writes in Eph 6:12, �For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.� Demons are very much in existence and very much the reality today as in Jesus� day. The trouble is that the secular world only recognises the existence of the mind and the body, and totally ignores the existence and the condition of the soul. Hence people can go to the doctor and be treated medically, or you can go to a psychiatrist, to have your mental health diagnosed. Both of these are important, but Jesus here is making a spiritual diagnosis of the man�s soul. He saw that at root to this man�s violence, self harm and extreme behaviour was an exposure and occupation of his soul by demons. A person can be possessed by demons through habitual unrepented sin, lust, violence, even pride through drug or alcohol addiction, and also through direct exposure to false religion and spirituality. The longer a person indulges in these influences the more danger they are to being completely taken over.  

Jesus really wanted to help and heal this man. So, he commanded it to come out of the man. How strong then was the power of the demons? Look at verse 29b. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. Luke says that he was possessed by the demon. When he was possessed by the demon, he behaved as if insane � his behaviour was violent and uncontrollable. He could not follow the norms of society. Lust, violence and hatred overpowered him. Nothing could control him even iron chains!
 
Read verse 30. �Jesus asked him, �What is your name?� �Legion,� he replied, because many demons had gone into him.� It had probably been a long time since someone had asked his name. The fact that people had chained means they treated him worse than their animals. They were unable to help this man and had given up on him.
He was not like this when he was young. He must have been a beloved child of his parents. Yet, from the time when he was possessed by demons, people only regarded him as a crazy man and never asked his name. Jesus however asked his name afresh. Jesus wanted to restore this person. He knew that he hadn�t originally been like this. He knew that though he didn�t wear clothes, nor lived at home but amongst the tombs, that he was not himself.

How did the man answer reply to Jesus? �Legion,� he replied, because many demons had gone into him.� The number of soldiers in a legion is 6,000. He had thousands of demons in him. This man was disfigured and tortured by 6,000 demons and hence had lost his true identity. No one understood him or loved him. Yet, Jesus came to him and asked this question � �What is your name?� � by asking this question, he was helping the man to find his true self and identity. 
6,000 demons, when their identities are revealed, could not live within the man anymore. At that time, they also saw 2,000 pigs. They wanted to get into the pigs. Jesus allowed them to do so. Suddenly, the pigs ran rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. In a word, Jesus sacrificed 2,000 pigs in order to save this one seemingly hopeless man. This shows how much sacrifice is needed to save even one soul. Jesus came into this world to save people like this man. He humbled himself and served people with God�s word from morning to night. And at the end, he gave his life on the cross as a ransom for all people. Jesus� mercy and love restored this most hopeless man. He had been so violent before but, now he had become a new creation dressed and in his right mind. People couldn�t find even a trace of the violence in him. The inner prison and oppression of lust, hatred, anger and depression was calmed by Jesus. His soul found true rest and peace through Jesus. This man received his life back through the grace of Jesus. His life was restored by Jesus� love. 
When people saw this, instead of thanking Jesus, they asked him to leave. They were afraid of the downfall of their pig industry instead of thinking of this man�s restoration. They rejected Jesus. Jesus got into the boat. The once demon-possessed man wanted to go with Jesus but, he didn�t allow him to do so. Jesus instead gave him a mission. Look at verses 38b and 39. �Jesus sent him away, saying, �Return home and tell how much God has done for you.� So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.� Jesus gave him a mission to tell the people of his town how much Jesus had done for him. Before, he didn�t have any life purpose or mission and was perhaps why he had become so enslaved by evil spirits. Yet, Jesus gave a clear mission to him to be a witness of the grace of salvation. The way to overcome our sinful nature and grow continually is to continually testify Jesus� amazing grace of salvation in our life. This man obeyed Jesus� command and went back to the town, testifying to Jesus� grace upon his life. He was completely transformed as a preacher of Jesus� love and grace.
Here I am struck by both Jesus authority and almighty power, and also his love for this man. In an age where people don�t acknowledge the devil or evil spirits, people are not less vulnerable to them but more vulnerable. As we as a culture go further and further away from the word of God, be become blind to the consequence of sin, and risk enslavement to Satan through a myriad of temptations. It�s interesting that it was in a gentile region that this extreme demon possession takes place. We are now not a Christian culture. The students we meet are so confident in their Enlightenment thinking and scientific logic, yet they still turn to internet porn, get completely wasted on drugs and alcohol, lose their purity and direction and become depressed and mentally ill. Then who will look after them, who is willing to sacrifice two thousand pigs for them? Their lectures, Psychiatrists, doctors? They need Jesus and they need Bible shepherds. Only Jesus has the power and the authority and love to help them. At times I can feel like the disciples tired, overwhelmed by my own problems, wanting my own time with Jesus, not wanting to serve others, being fearful of the hostile aggressive reception I might find when I set foot in the region of the university grounds.  But I need to find Jesus� heart and faith. I need to be careful though, that I don�t become calculating like the people of the Gerasenes, not wanting to pay the price for one human soul, wanting instead to guard my own life, career and ignore those in need. Jesus asks me �What is your name?� do you care enough for my people to reach out to them? I thank Jesus who has the power and the love for one soul.
