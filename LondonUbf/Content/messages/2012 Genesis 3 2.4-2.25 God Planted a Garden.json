GOD PLANTED A GARDEN

Genesis 2:4-25
Key verse 2:8 
Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. 

Last week we learned how God made man in the image of God as the pinnacle of his creation. “In the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.” In Genesis chapter 2 we look in more detail at how he created man and how he planted a garden for him. In this passage we can learn how much God loves man and desires his happiness. We can also see how he established a covenant relationship with him. There are five parts to this message, each of them teaches us an important blessing God gives to man, and through this teaches us a right relationship to god and a right relationship to his creation. So I pray that through this message God may help us to learn more who we are, God’s love and grace on us.

I. God formed the man and breathed into him the breath of life

Look at verse 4. “This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.” Genesis 1 talks about the creation from the perspective of the ‘big picture’ and also reveals God’s creation power and authority. Genesis 2 focuses more on the creation of man, his environment and God’s special relationship with him. Until now God had been referred to as Elohim, now he is referred to as "the Lord God". Lord here is Yahweh Elohim which emphasises the personal covenant name of God who desires a loving relationship with us. God who created us in his image is our personal God. Then what was the status of the earth before creation? Look at verse 5. “Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth[a] and no plant had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground.” This verse reminds us of the primordial form of the world before the completion of the six days. It recalls Genesis 1:2, "Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface and the deep, in the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters." In that sense Verses 4 to 6 remind us that God needed to bring form to the world and create an environment for man to live in. This was his provision and love.

Then, how did God created man? Look at verse 7. “Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.” In the last two messages we heard how important it is for us to know our origin and our nature, where we come from and who we are. This verse tells about two important truths of human nature so that we can have a right understanding of ourselves.  

First, God formed us from the dust. God created man from the dust. Adam comes from the Hebrew ‘adamah’ which means dust or ground. We are made from dust and to dust we will return (Ecclesiastes 3:20). The word ‘form’ here recalls the kind of forming a potter does with his fingers, to make a jar or a clay sculpture. God is involved in forming us, which belies the idea we evolve from apes. But it also tells us we are nothing but a fragile vessel made of the dust (Isa 45:9, 2 Corin 4:7, 2 Tim 2:20, Rom 9:21). Therefore we need to acknowledge our weaknesses and honour our creator God. When we do so, we can be humble and rely on God depending on his amazing power (1 Cor 12:9).

Secondly, man is given breath by God.  “God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.” It's an amazing and mysterious thing that something inanimate like carbon and water can become a living sentient being. Science is very good at telling us about physical matter and how things work, but science cannot really explain what life is and the origin of life. When I was a teenager at the age of 17 I saw my mother die. That moment was incredibly tragic and sad, but it was also the moment that I really began to think about life and where life comes from and where life goes to. Because at that moment I saw my mother had been living but now she was no longer there and what was left was a shell, the shell that would soon go to dust. So the question is who was my mother, and where did she come from and where did she go to became very concentrated at that moment. And here in this verse we see the answer, God's breath.

Each of our lives can be measured in the breaths that we take. What did we do to start breathing? The answer is nothing, we did nothing to deserve it, we were simply were given it and received it. Did our mothers give us breath? No, I just saw my daughter Jessie born, I know Jieun did nothing to give Jessie breath, she was too busy catching her own. I did nothing to give Jesse breath, and Jessie herself didn’t do anything other than breath. We also cannot determine when we will stop breathing. Breathing itself is God’s grace and undeserved favour from beginning to end! He gives and sustains our breath and decides when it ends.  

How we spend our lives however, how we use the breath we have been given is our responsibility. We are stewards of our lives, and determine how we spend them. In that context it is worth thinking about God’s breath not only as physical breath but also the breath of his Holy Spirit. Remember in John chapter 20 when Jesus appeared to his disciples and he breathed on them and said, "receive the Holy Spirit" (19). When we die our physical body will return to the earth but our soul will return to God (Ecclesiastes 3:20-21). We are given the breath of life not simply to exist physically but to bear spiritual fruit and live for the glory of God. 

II. God created the Garden of Eden (8-15)

Look at verse 8. “Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed, God created the garden of Eden.” Just as God formed man and gave him breath, so it was entirely the love and grace of God to put him in Eden. Eden means delight or bliss in Hebrew. God created a paradise for him.  Here one has an image of a loving father wanting the very best for his child, preparing the perfect environment. From this verse and from this Chapter we can learn God’s essential desire for man is his happiness, a grace man did not earn and love that he did nothing to deserve, simply given. God hasn’t changed, his love is the same, yesterday, today and forever, and it’s the image and generosity of this loving God we need to hold in our hearts.

Look at verse 9. “The LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground – trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.” It was full of beautiful trees and flowers as well as delicious fruit. The garden lacked nothing. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The Tree of life is evidence of God’s promise for eternal life and blessing. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was the declaration that it is God alone who is truly good and decides what is good and evil. 

These two trees were essential for Adam’s spiritual happiness. In verses 10-1 we can see how beautiful the garden of Eden was.  There were four rivers that started from Eden. The name of the first is the Pishon; The name of the second river is the Gihon;  The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. The surroundings of those rivers were beautiful. They were full of gold, aromatic resin and precious stones. The Tigris and the Euphrates are still identifiable where the oldest civilizations have been traced. God provided the perfect environment for man’s happiness.

III. God gave man work
Look at verse 15. “ The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.” If these days we can have a negative understanding of work. This is because we associate work with before, and toil and sweat of our brow. But in this verse we see work existed in the garden. This work was in burdensome but it was a role that God gave man in order to ensure his happiness. From this we can learn that there is a part of work which is innately noble and essential for our fulfilment in life. Man is an active, creative being, he is made in the image of God. You he needs to find expression for all the gifts and attributes God has given him. And we are called by God to take care of the environment he gives us. Work in this sense can best be defined as rearranging the environment for the flourishing of everyone. God gives us the raw materials of life in order that we may bear fruit for him. Taking care, means appreciating, loving, nurturing, being creative, and responsibly maintaining and helping to grow that which God has given us. The wonder of life therefore is not just waiting to get to heaven, but in serving God where we are. Therefore whatever we do we can do for the glory of God, this is a great blessing!

Work in this sense is not linked to any particular profession. However people can lose the blessing of work when they turn work into an idol. If their primary motive for work is money or status or power, then work becomes a source of competitive anxiety, and we lose our peace of God. We can have the right relationship to our work when we have a right relationship to God and make sure that we are working for God's glory. Then working and taking care of that which God has entrusted to us is a source of great blessing. Since the fall of man, alongside any work we might have in the world, as believers we are called to participate in the redemptive work of God, namely the salvation of souls through Jesus Christ. God entrusted to us a world that is dying, but world that is suffering from a broken relationship to God and a world that is condemned. I pray that God may use each of us to take care of his redemptive work in this generation. This is our urgent and most holy mission.

IV the blessing of God's covenant command

Look at verses 16-17. “And the LORD God commanded the man, ‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;  but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will surely die.’”Adam could eat from any tree, including the Tree of Life and live forever. However there was one tree he must not eat from, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This was the command which God gave Adam to obey. With a clear warning that if he failed to keep the command he would surely die. That’s why it was called Adam’s bible. Then, who is God who gave him the command ?

First, God commanded man to keep creation order. God created all the earth with his mighty power. He created man in his own image and blessed him abundantly. He made man to eat all the fruit in the garden. He gave man great freedom and made them happy.  However, when man only enjoys God’s blessing, it is easy to forget the creator God. God therefore he gave him a holy command. “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.’ Whenever man walked around the garden of Eden and looked at the tree, he could remember the creator God and this command. Through this command, God helped the man to remember creation order and right relationship to God, as God. 

His creator helped him not to forget God’s blessing and grace and live a life that worshipped and glorified him through obedience. God therefore called the name of the tree as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil)'. The knowledge of good and evil belongs to God alone. What God calls good is good and what he calls evil is evil. Sinful man, having eaten from the tree always wants to redefine what is good and evil based on his sinful desire. It means out of pride to put himself in God’s position. Eating the fruit of good and evil was to challenge God’s authority and destroy creation order. It meant self-destruction. God loves man so he commanded him to keep the creation order. God wants men not to misuse his freedom but to be truly free through obedience to his word. Only when we obey God’s command can we experience true freedom. 

By obeying those commands, we can put our creator God in the first place of our heart. When we destroy his creation order and become disobedient to his commands, our relationship with him is also broken and we can no longer enjoy happiness and blessing from God. God gave Adam command not to eat the fruit of good and evil to make him truly happy. It is the command of God’s love. 

Second. God wants us to willingly obey him.“You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will surely die.’ This verse shows that God gave man a free will to choose or not to choose to obey his words. God created man to have free will. He didn’t create us like a robot. He knew the danger of our disobedience yet he still gave us free will because he wanted us to know his great love and worship him in truth and spirit. He wants us to obey him willingly and happily. We of course have freedom this very day to worship God or to go out with friends. Yet, we came here to worship him willingly. God is pleased when we worship him willingly from our heart. 

V God instituted marriage (18-25)

God created Garden of Eden for man and gave him the blessing of his commands. Then, he also gave him a suitable helper. Look at verse 18. “ The LORD God said, ‘It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” God knew that Adam needed a suitable helper. Look at verse 19-20. “Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.  So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.” In doing so, Adam needed to know the characteristics of each living creature. It was not easy to do on his own. God therefore provided him a suitable helper. Here, “help” is not demeaning but particularly refers to active help like God’s help or military assistance at a time of war. Help in that sense means life saving reinforcement. God gave Adam a suitable helper in order for him to carry out his mission well. Woman is created in order to help man. 

In doing so, they need to know what the missions God has given the man they are to marry. Also, she needs to correct him when he goes astray. When he is weak, she needs to encourage him and help him. Hence, woman needs to be spiritually very alert to help the man stay on track. 

Then, how did God give him a suitable helper? “God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh. Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.” This shows that husband and wife form one body. Adam was so happy and confessed, this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called “woman”, for she was taken out of man. This confession is not just emotional. It comes from Adam’s deep gratitude towards God and is based on his faith that it is God who sent him his suitable helper. We learn her that it is God who instituted marriage. We can see that it is God who knew Adam’s need of a helper and also it is God who brought the woman to Adam. God instituted marriage. Jesus said, “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh”[a]? 6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.” 

Look at verse 24. “That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.” This verse shows what a biblical marriage is. First, a man needs to leave his father and mother. It means to be free from parents and live an independent life. When a man marries, he needs to be mentally, spiritually and financially independent. He needs to be the head of the household. Second, man needs to be united to his wife. Being united means for two becomes one. This does not happen naturally, both husband and wife have to grow in spiritual maturity. Through marriage, a man and a woman becomes one new person and live a new life. Man may look strong but inwardly they can be weak. On the other hand, woman may look weak but can be strong inwardly. In marriage, in being united to each other, a man and a woman need to embrace each other’s weakness but encourages strong points. A man and a woman can become truly one when they share faith, life direction and mission. Being united also means physical unity. By loving and confessing love to each other and raising up children together, a man and a woman can be united.  “Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.” This verse tells us that the two become one body with love and also reflects Adam’s happiness through his marriage. 

From this passage, I learn God’s original blessing on man, the gift of life, the garden, work, his command and marriage. What strikes me is that none of these things are deserved but are God’s gift of grace and the result of the covenant relationship he established from the beginning. Next week we will learn that sin broke the covenant and brought so much misery and suffering into the world. But from this passage I learn that all these blessings can be redeemed and restored when we meet Jesus. And again, this is not a covenant based on deserving but based on God’s one sided love and grace, this time with the added cost of Jesus’ sacrifice and forgiveness. 

In conclusion, God created man and he didn’t spare anything. He is our loving and merciful God. May God help us to put him in the first place of our heart and love him with all our heart and soul and might.  May God help us to obey his command from our heart and be truly blessed by him.
