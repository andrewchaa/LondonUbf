THE WAY TO ETERNAL LIFE

Luke 18:18-43
Key Verse 18:22
�When Jesus heard this, he said to him, �You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.�� 

Last week Jesus taught his disciples they should always pray and not give up, but also in a parable, he contrasted a Pharisee who couldn�t find his sin with a tax collector who beat his breast sincerely saying �God have mercy on me a sinner.� Today we come across two men in reality. One is rich and respectable but is blind to his sin problem. He walks away from Jesus sad and without eternal life. The other is a blind beggar who cries out �Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!� I pray that from this passage we may open our spiritual eyes learn to value Jesus and eternal life more than anything in this world.

I. A rich ruler and eternal life (18-22) 

Look at verse 18. �A certain ruler came up to Jesus and asked, �Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?� A quick background on this man: He was sincere, Mark tells us he ran up to Jesus and fell on his knees,(10:17), Matthew says he was young (Mt 19:20) and everyone says he has great wealth. He was a ruler, probably meaning he had a junior position in the Sanhedrin. Therefore anyone looking at him could think he has it all, money, religious sincerity, morality and influence, he is the guy everyone would love to be, he should have been happy. But no, he comes to Jesus in need.

�Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?� He had everything apart from eternal life, and therefore he wasn�t happy, he wasn�t satisfied and came to Jesus in desperation. This tells us something about the human condition; that we can have everything, but without eternal life we have no peace, we feel something is missing, a deep hole. So what is eternal life? What was this man thinking of when he talks of eternal life? The Bible tells us everyone will live eternally, that the soul doesn�t die and that everyone will have to give an account before God�s judgment (Mt 25: 46). This man had everything, he had the perfect CV but deep down he still wasn�t sure that when it came to God�s judgment, he would be ok. Remember, Jesus has been teaching that the kingdom of God is not only what happens at the moment of God�s judgment, it also begins right now within you. Perhaps the man had heard Jesus talking to the Pharisees and had found no such experience of God in his heart. If eternal life meant to have a deep personal relationship with his father in heaven, if it meant to know his peace, truth, joy and a deep sense of God�s grace and forgiving love, then again this man knew something was lacking, this disturbed him enough to sincerely come to Jesus to ask his help.

This man is not unique. Nowadays people seem to only crave money and secular pleasure. But that is not true. Everyone deep down has the desire to find eternal life. Yesterday I was standing on the third floor of Whittington hospital thinking about eternal life for this message. From there one can see a great view of the city of London with London�s new �Shard� skyscraper being built, nearby was St Paul�s cathedral. It was built three hundred years ago. So many people have since passed through this world. Down stairs in the cafeteria people were passing through buying a coffee and then going. This life is a life of passing through. We pass through school, jobs, friends come and go. There is nothing concrete, we come and we go. But where from and where to? People have that question. Deep down, it causes us anxiety that no amount of money or success or status can satisfy. Why do people have the desire for eternal life? It is because, originally, human beings were created as eternal beings. (Ge 2:7) Human beings were created to live forever without tasting death. But since the Fall, men lost eternal life. 

The ruler asked Jesus, �Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?� He called Jesus �Good teacher�. Of course Jesus is good because he is God. He is sinless. (Heb 4:15) But the reason why the ruler thought Jesus was good was not because he believed that Jesus was God. His idea of good was on a relative scale, that there are good people and bad people and he is a good person and is able to recognize another good person in Jesus. This reveals his problem of spiritual blindness. The bible teaches us there are only sinners and sinless. God is sinless, Jesus is without sin, but everyone else needs God�s mercy. Everyone like the tax collector in the parable needs to beat his breast and cry out, God have mercy on me. This young man thought perhaps he was just below Jesus on the good scale, he was doing well and could become good enough to qualify for eternal life by doing just something more. �What must I do to inherit eternal life?� He thought that eternal life was a reward which he could claim by doing good. He did not know that he was a sinful man before God. 
 
Jesus knew his spiritual problem and told him. Look at verse 19. ��Why do you call me good?� Jesus answered. �No one is good--except God alone.�� Jesus told him that God alone was good. The rich ruler had to accept his sinfulness and come to God for forgiveness. This is how we can be saved through our faith in Jesus. Proud people can never be saved because they do not trust in God�s righteousness but insist on their own righteousness. All men are sinners before God. (Ro 3:10, 23) Men�s righteousness is like a filthy rag before God. All men need God�s mercy for salvation. (Ti 3:5) 

Jesus wanted to help the man open his eyes to his spiritual reality with the Ten Commandments. Look at verse 20. �You know the commandments: �Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honour your father and mother.�� Jesus told him the five commandments concerning one�s neighbour so that he could find that he had fallen short of the requirements of the law. What was his reply? Look at verse 21. �All these I have kept since I was a boy.� The man didn�t understand what God�s commandments were for, they are not to be used to tell us what a good job we are doing, they are there to reveal where we are falling short of God�s holiness. The man�s answer revealed that his relationship with God�s word was superficial. He thought that he hadn�t done anything wrong. He thought that he had kept the whole law without fail. Outwardly he might have looked perfect, but Jesus is always more concerned with a person�s mind and heart. 

Anyone else listening to this man might have given him 10 out of 10, and said �you are doing fine, just carry on.� Perhaps the man also just wanted reassurance that indeed he was good. But Jesus wouldn�t leave him in this spiritual blindness. The young man needed to move from the Pharisee who said, �I thank you Lord that I am not like other men� to crying out �have mercy on me, a sinner.� He needed to find himself as the tax collector in need of God�s mercy and grace. This also challenges us to think about our relationship to the word of God. As we personally reflect on Jesus� words, are they showing us our need of Jesus, our need of his mercy and forgiving love or simply reinforcing our self-righteousness? At least the man had come to Jesus and asked him for his assessment, as we come to Jesus� words, it is good to pray for the Holy Spirit and ask Jesus to show us and reveal to us who we are. This is a question to ask throughout our lives, and is the way to keep coming to Jesus humbly, honestly and repentantly. 

II. Sell everything and follow Jesus

Jesus wanted to help the man find himself and inherit eternal life. Read verse 22. �When Jesus heard this, he said to him, �You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.�� We can think about this verse in four points. First, �Go, sell everything you have.� This was Jesus challenging the man�s wrong priorities. Jesus urged him to put God first rather than his wealth. John 17:3 says that eternal life means to know God, and Jesus Christ. What does it mean to know God? It means to have a right relationship with God. It means to love God with all our heart, with all our soul and with all our strength. It means to put him first and worship him only. The young man served money and he trusted in his wealth. Money was his idol and, in that sense, he was an idol worshipper. It was no wonder that he did not have the assurance of eternal life. The ruler had to sell everything to get rid of what he loved more than God.  

In order to have eternal life we must sell those things which we love more than God, and establish a right relationship with God just as Abraham had to sacrifice his only son Isaac and put God first. (Ge 22:2) The things which we love more than God can vary, for instance, they can be the desire to live a comfortable life, our dream of marriage, or the desire to be �considered good�, our reputation, status self-glory, success. This man�s wealth was more than just money, it was everything that came with it. They may even be good things our wives or children may be our idols. Our church can be our idol. That�s the difficulty with idols, they can go hidden in our hearts for a long time. An indication of what our idol is, can be our irritation when we are challenged by Jesus to let it go. We might get angry, or start making excuses and justify why this thing is good. The point is our idols are anything that competes with Jesus for first place in our hearts. Whatever it may be we must sell 100% of it. If we just sell 99%, the remaining 1% will corrupt us again. We can sell 100% of it when we know that everything in the world will eventually perish and fade away. When we sell what we cherish in the world, we come to have a right relationship with God. Then we come to have the peace and true joy which comes from God. To have eternal life is not something just for the future. Eternal life begins now. We can have eternal life now and we retain this eternal life into the age to come. (1Jn 5:13, Lk 17:21)   

Second, �and give to the poor�. Jesus told the man to sell and give to the poor. This meant that he had to actively love and serve his neighbour. In the past, he had just kept the commandments passively, doing no harm to others. Yet that was not enough. To sum up these five commandments meant to love your neighbour as yourself. Eternal life in Jesus does not mean living a self-centred life, doing no harm to others. One must actively do good to others by loving them as oneself. This man could have begun to quickly find his limited love, his selfishness and even his idolatry if he had even attempted to give to the poor. Likewise we can very quickly find our need for Jesus� grace as soon as we begin to try and serve others with the gospel.

Third, �you will have treasure in heaven.� Jesus commanded him to put his treasure in heaven rather than on earth. The ruler said he wanted eternal life but, in reality, he wanted to live on earth enjoying his wealth forever. Fourth, �Then come, follow me.� Once we have made the decision to sell, we must follow Jesus. Why is following Jesus so important? Simply because he is our Christ and God and only he is worthy of our worship. If we don�t actively follow Jesus and give our life and our heart to him in worship other idols will quickly come in. We may get rid of one idol only to fill it with another. Therefore we must take hold of eternal life by following Jesus. As a Christian, following Jesus is not an option. It is a must. 

Jesus loved the ruler and gave him this invaluable teaching so that he might inherit eternal life. How did he respond to Jesus? Look at verse 23. �When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.� Jesus� teaching was too difficult for him to accept. He wanted to inherit eternal life but he did not want to lose his great wealth. He wanted eternal life and at the same time his worldly life on earth. But no one can serve both God and money. (Mt 6:24) Here we learn that we have to sell everyday. If we store things up, without selling them each day, we will find it hard to sell them later because they become too big. 

Look at verse 23. �Jesus looked at him and said, �How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!�� If one is rich, it is easy to trust in one�s riches. The power of money is strong. Wealthy people are liked and served because of their money and it is hard for them to be humble and to trust in God. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.  This does not necessarily mean that money is evil and a rich person cannot enter the kingdom of God. Rather we need to be in control of it by having the right view of it. Everyone in this room is richer than this rich young man. In history there has never been a wealthier generation. We all have great wealth, let�s not fool ourselves into thinking we are poor. Rather let�s pray to be free of the idol of money and steward it wisely for God�s work. 

Look at verse 28. �Peter said to him, �We have left all we had to follow you!�� The call to follow Jesus is also the most amazing blessing of all. Sometimes like Peter, we can be too aware of what we give up or sacrifice to follow our Christ rather than being aware of the grace and the privilege. The story of the rich young man is one of the most tragic in the gospels because he came so close to receiving the most amazing life call. He had no idea of the extraordinary privilege of following Jesus; if he had he would have dropped everything. Jesus� invitation was an invitation to be free of all the nonsense and lies that wealth or any idol grips us with. Idols always disappoint. They promise so much but they leave us empty, bitter and thirsting. This young man became sad, Mark says he went away sad. We don�t know what happened to the man, only that he never received eternal life, and anyone who walks away from Jesus ends up missing out on life�s adventure, life�s ultimate meaning and life�s joy. 

Jesus gave his disciples a wonderful promise in verses 29, 30. ��I tell you the truth,� Jesus said to them, �no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life.�� With these words Jesus tells us there is a cost to making a clear commitment to him, our families might not immediately understand, they may never understand. But he promises that whatever decision we make for him we will not fail to receive as much in this age and in the age to come, eternal life. In verses 31 43 Jesus tells of his own cost to bring us eternal life through his death on the cross. We also witness a blind beggar who saw the true value of Jesus� kingdom. Unlike the rich ruler, he cried out, �Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!�

In conclusion, eternal life is the most valuable treasure. How can we secure eternal life? We must sell the things that we cherish more than God. By establishing a right relationship with God, we can have eternal life. We must actively do good for our neighbours by praying for them and by teaching them the words of God. Holding on to our eternal life, we must follow Jesus. May God help us to enjoy eternal life today and in the age to come. We praise God that he has given us eternal life through Jesus our Lord.
