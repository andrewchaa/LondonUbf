THAT IS WHY I WAS SENT
Luke 4:14-44
Key verse 4:43
�I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.�

In the last passage of Luke�s gospel we learned how Jesus overcame temptation in the desert by relying on the Holy Spirit. In this passage Jesus begins his ministry preaching the gospel through the power of the Holy Spirit. Preaching the word of God was Jesus� number one priority. People wanted different things from him but Jesus knew that only the word of God can save people�s souls. As Bible teachers we have also been called to preach the word of God to change people�s lives. I pray that through today�s message we may be reminded that this is why we have been sent. 
Look at verses 14 and 15; �Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He taught in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.� Jesus returned from the desert filled with the power of the Holy Spirit and he began to preach in Galilee. Jesus preaching was powerful, full of the Holy Spirit, people were moved and everyone praised him. Jesus preaching ministry had begun powerfully and successfully. 
Eventually Jesus reached his home town of Nazareth. Look at verse 16; �He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. And he stood up to read.� What did Jesus do in Nazareth? We can see that he did, as was his custom; he went into the synagogue and read the passage. We can imagine what this was like. Jesus was the local boy who everyone knew. Some people had been his friends and grown up playing with him. Others were his neighbours, aunts, uncles and teachers. Everyone would have remembered him, everyone had an opinion about him or a memory of him and everyone was waiting to see what he would say and do. 
Verse 17 tells us that Jesus found the place in Isaiah he wanted to read from. Look at verses 18 and 19: �The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour.� 
What Jesus read was Isaiah�s prophecy that the Messiah who would come for the people of Israel. The Messiah was Jesus so Jesus read this passage with real authority. What does it say? Look at verse 18a; �The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.� The first thing that we can learn from this passage is that God anointed with Jesus his Spirit in order to preach. Jesus had come to preach the word of God. Who was Jesus preaching to? Verse 18 says he came to preach the good news to the poor. Who are the poor? The poor are those who realise they need God�s word, grace and mercy. Revelation (3:17) says; �You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realise that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.� Spiritually we are all poor because we are all sinners. Mankind�s number one problem is sin and the only solution to sin is the word of God. Therefore Jesus was anointed to preach the good news that we can be free from our sin when we believe in him. Jesus came to preach to the poor in spirit, the spiritually humble people whose hearts are open to hear and accept the word of God.
Jesus said he had come to preach good news and he talked about four things. First freedom for prisoners. Prisoners to sin are enslaved by hidden desires like lust, ambition, jealousy or envy which completely take over their lives. Everything they do is to fulfil their sinful desires. Second, recovery of sight for the blind. Blind people cannot see where they are going and so risk having accidents and hurting ourselves more than other people. Spiritually blind people have the same problem. When we are spiritually blind we end up hurting ourselves and others around us through our sinful acts. Third, to release the oppressed. Oppressed people are weighed down by life and what other people think of them. Oppression makes us restless, joyless and depressed. 
Prisoners, blind people and oppressed people live heavy difficult lives because of the weight of sin. But Jesus proclaims; freedom for the prisoners, recovery of sight for the blind and release for the oppressed. This is the year of the Lord�s favour because Jesus has come into the world to preach the gospel which frees us from sin and death.  
Look at verses 20-21. Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, preached, gave the scroll back to the attendant and sat down. All the people in the synagogue fastened their eyes on Jesus without a hint of distraction. Jesus said to them, �Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.�� We can imagine Jesus� face shining with the power of the Holy Spirit and all the people watching him in silence. Jesus was proclaiming to them that he was the promised Messiah. 
What was the reaction of the people? Look at verse 22. �All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips.� The people had really enjoyed what Jesus said. These people confessed that they received grace from Jesus� words. But instead of allowing the word of God into their hearts they said; �Isn�t this Joseph�s son?� They could only see the local boy and this blinded them to the fact that Jesus was the Messiah.   
But Jesus was not content to stop here because he loved them and he wanted to save them. Look at verse 23; �Jesus said to them, Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself! Do here in your home town what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.' The people were hoping that Jesus would perform miracles and healings for them as he had in Capernaum. But Jesus knew that the real problem for the people of Nazareth was that they did not understand that they were the poor, the prisoners, the blind and the oppressed. They needed salvation but they believed they were already saved because they were Jews and because they were from Jesus� town. 
Look at verse 24; �I tell you the truth, he continued, no prophet is accepted in his home town.� Jesus knew these people would reject him so he told them the stories of the widow of Zarephath and Naaman the Syrian. Both of these people were foreigners and idol worshippors. The widow was at the lowest point in society and Naaman was a soldier who persecuted the Israelites. These were people who the Israelites hated. Yet Jesus showed them that it was these foreigners who were humble enough to accept God�s prophets; Elijah and Elisha, see themselves as sinners before God and consequently receive the blessings which God wanted to give them. 
Like them the people of Nazareth needed to humble themselves, confess their sins and accept Jesus as their Messiah. But this was too much for them. They could only see Joseph�s son, not the son of God so they took Jesus to a cliff and tried to kill him; �But he just walked right through the crowd and went on his way.�
Look at verses 31 and 32; �Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath began to teach the people. They were amazed at his teaching, because his message had authority.� Jesus left Nazareth and went to Capernaum where he preached the gospel. The people were amazed because he had authority. Here we can ask ourselves where Jesus� power and authority came from. First, we are reminded that Jesus preached with the power of the Holy Spirit. Second, Jesus knew understood the word of God deeply. We can only speak authoritatively about what we know. I can talk about education but I cannot talk about fashion. Third, there was no gap between Jesus� knowledge and his life, he odeyed the word of God fully unlike the Pharisees. Finally, Jesus absolutely believed in the word, he knew its value, its truth, its life and the urgent need of people to receive it. Jesus could preach the gospel because he knew it was true and because he had the power of the Holy Spirit. May God help us to grow in spiritual authority like Jesus. 
Over the next few verses we see Jesus casting out demons, healing Simon�s mother in law and then at the end of the Sabbath we see him healing all the sick and demon possessed people. This was Jesus� heart and care for the people. He really loved them, he saw their suffering and he wanted to help them but Jesus knew that sickness was not the biggest problem facing these people. He knew that what they really needed was the word of God. The first demon came out when Jesus was preaching the word of God in the synagogue. Jesus rebuked the fever in Simon�s mother in law and rebuked the demons so we see that even here he was demonstrating the power of the word of God to the people. 
Look at verse 42; �At daybreak Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.� We see here that each morning Jesus went to a solitary place to pray and be with God. This was the daily source of his spiritual power. Through coming to God through daily morning prayer he could find God�s direction for the day and his power to preach the gospel.
What happened whilst Jesus was praying? The people came to persuade him to stay in Capernaum and heal people. Look at verse 43; �But he said, I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.� Jesus was popular. He could have set himself up in Capernaum and done good work as a doctor. But look at Jesus� words; �he said, I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God.� Again Jesus is telling us that it is the word of God which really matters. Physical healing is good but what people need most is forgiveness of sin through the word of God. Jesus might have been tempted to stay and heal but to really be a blessing he had to be obedient to God�s call and preach the good news of freedom from sin and death. It mustn�t have been easy for Jesus to refuse the pleading of the people who came to him. But Jesus because he had spent time in fellowship with God he could say; �That is why I was sent,� 
Like Jesus we are all preachers. Each time we teach the Bible, speak to a student or simply have a conversation with another person we are preaching the gospel. Like Jesus we have a great and privileged calling and responsibility. God is giving us the job of telling people how they can be saved from sin and death. Every day we have opportunities to preach. Yesterday I had a bible study with a student from UCL. Before that I had a short conversation with Ben from football about creation. Last week I taught a lesson to year 9 about justice using Leviticus and the gospel. When we really look at our lives we have opportunities to preach the gospel almost every day.
What can we learn from Jesus about preaching the gospel? First we learn that the root of our authority and power is our faith in God and the power of the Holy Spirit. Second, like Jesus we are anointed by God to preach the word of God and we need to hold onto this identity as people sent by God to save people from sin and death. Third we need to love those we are preaching to. This means we need to know them, know what is in their hearts and tell them what they need to hear even if this is something they don�t want to hear. Fourth we need to care for people practically so they can see God�s love in us not just hear it in our words. We see that Jesus did not just preach using words but he served people in order that could see his love for them. Yet whatever he did it was focused on them receiving the word of God. Fifth we need be obedient to our calling. There are many good things we could be doing with our lives but as Bible teachers we have been called to do the greatest thing; to save people�s souls. However good the other possibilities may be we must not allow ourselves to be distracted from this task.
Preaching the gospel is a spiritual battle. We are fighting for the souls of individual people. We need to ask ourselves who we are preaching to. Do we have a clear idea of the people for whom we are praying? Do we spend time in prayer for them? Do we struggle to allow the Holy Spirit to come into our hearts each day as Jesus did and do we struggle with the word of God so that we get to know and love Jesus more ourselves? When we are full of the Spirit, when our focus is really on Jesus and we really love those he sends us then we can preach powerfully and change people�s lives. But Satan wants to stop us from fulfilling our calling. He tempts us away in many ways; distracting us from prayer so we become powerless and tempting us to do good things rather than following our calling to preach the word of God. Therefore we need to struggle each day to guard our hearts and hold on to our mission to preach the gospel because this is why we have been sent.
In conclusion. Jesus teaches us that the reason he came into the world was to preach the good news of the kingdom of heaven. Mankind�s greatest problem is sin. Only the word of God can save people from sin. God has also called us to this great mission to preach the gospel every day. I pray that each of us would hold onto this calling, our faith and the power of the Holy Spirit every day so that we can remain faithful to our mission and be used to save souls in this generation.
