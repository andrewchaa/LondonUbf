YOU ARE WITNESSES OF ALL THESE

Luke 24:1-53
Key verse 24:47
�and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.�

Last week we learned about the cross of Jesus, the meaning of Jesus� death and the impact it has on our lives. Today we learn about the resurrection of Jesus. Like his death, Jesus resurrection is central to our Christian faith and is the most profound and important event to have ever happened in human history. We see how the fact of Jesus� resurrection transformed the women and his disciples from heartbroken and fearful people into joyful and victorious servants. But also we can think what effect Jesus� resurrection has on our lives today. I pray each of us may meet personally the risen Jesus, and hear his world mission command.

This message is in four parts. The first three parts will look at the evidence for the fact of Jesus� resurrection, and the fourth part will look at the reason why Jesus rose and what that means for us today.

First. Evidence for Jesus� resurrection at the tomb

Look at verse 1. �On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.� Jesus had died at 3pm on the Friday afternoon. It was now very early Sunday morning. Luke talks of �the women.� Verse 10 describes them in more detail as Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James and the others with them. These women had been with Jesus at the crucifixion. They had seen his untold agony and suffering, they had witnessed the soldiers plunge the spear into his side making certain his death. We can only imagine the agony of Jesus� mother, who earlier in this gospel had been prophesied by Simeon that �a sword will pierce your own soul too�(Lk 2:35). To watch her own son be tortured to death must have pierced her heart, and left the others, all of whom had received so much grace and love and new life from Jesus, utterly traumatised. At the end of the previous chapter we are told that having watched Jesus be laid in Joseph of Arimathea�s tomb �they went home to prepare spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.�(23:56) We can think how hard that Sabbath would have been, filled with sorrow and the power of death, time ticking very slowly by. They couldn�t understand how someone so good, so loving, so truthful could be so brutally treated. All they wanted was to run to the tomb and pay their final respects. We see their love, their sorrow and the power of death overwhelming their hearts.

Look at verse 2,3. �They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.� Luke tells us what they found but more importantly what they didn�t find. The large stone that had been placed to keep people out had been rolled away. This stone would have been too big for the women to move, something in their grief they had not practically planned for when they had set out. Yet far more astounding there was no body, no Jesus. Many here will already heard about the evidence of the empty tomb as powerful testimony of Jesus� resurrection, but for those who haven�t it�s worth going over. If there is no body what has happened to it? There are three interested parties that could have taken it: the Romans, the Jewish leaders, or the disciples. We know from Matthew�s gospel that the Romans had put a guard in front of the tomb. They had no reason and no desire to move it, nor would the religious leaders who had a vested interest in keeping Jesus very much dead, they would have later produced the body as evidence that he had not risen. Which leaves the disciples. Later in the passage we see how terrified they were, how they could not even imagine Jesus had risen, and how much persuasion they needed, but most compellingly, their transformation and boldness with which they later testified to Jesus� resurrection could not be sustained with a knowing lie. Who would die for a lie? Why would they be martyred for a scam? Later Paul testifies to more than 500 brothers who had seen the risen Jesus at the same time (1 Co 15:6). The empty tomb is powerful evidence that Jesus is risen.

Look at verses 4-6, �While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, �Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:� The angel�s question is quite funny in its simplicity. Their logic is flawless, one simply doesn�t find living people in tombs, it isn�t the appropriate place. Yet their question also points out the women�s problem. They were looking for a dead Jesus, the one they had so graphically, and vividly and physically witnessed dying. This experience was their minds� eye and after watching his death they couldn�t think he could be alive. But what the angel�s were saying was their traumatic experience was now blinding them from the reality of Jesus� resurrection. Because their hearts were full of death and sorrow, they could not see or think that life could be different, they could not see the reality of God�s kingdom or his power to raise Jesus from the dead. They could not receive the new living hope that Jesus wanted to give them. 

We can be the same. There are many times in life that can be traumatic, or disheartening, or discouraging, where we feel the wind is knocked out of us. Something happens to break our hearts like the death of a loved one, or the illness of a friend, we might suffer the trauma and fear of losing a job, or the sickening feeling of financial insecurity or we might be stung by someone�s betrayal or attack. There are many life experiences that can fill our hearts with discouragement, fear and death, and it makes it very difficult to look for the risen Jesus. Instead we see only death and sorrow and remain powerless. At that time we need to hear the angel�s declaration, �Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; he has risen!� and understand that what we are feeling is not in fact the reality but our sorrow and fatalism. The angels declare the fact of Jesus resurrection, that no matter how powerful death seems in our hearts, no matter how real our experiences, no matter how oppressive the darkness, the fear the sorrow, Jesus has defeated death, he has risen and is with us now. Until Jesus rose death always had the final say. It had conquered everything, even those Jesus had raised. But Jesus rising from the dead is very different. Death could not hold onto him. He has risen as a first fruit of all those who believe in him. i.e he has gone first to prepare a place for us. The angels declare this, He has risen! The empty tomb declares this and the witness of the women declare it. We simply need to look for his living presence in our lives. But this brings us to our next question, �How?� How, when we experience profound discouragement can we look for and find the risen Jesus? To answer this we can see how the angels help the women and this brings us to the next part of this message.

Second. Evidence of the resurrection through God�s word.

Look at 6b-8. �Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: The son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.� Then they remembered his words.� The angels as God�s messengers who always seem to have a fearful effect on people could have just relied on their authority as messengers, but they didn�t. They reminded the women of what Jesus had previously taught. He had taught about his betrayal death and resurrection on many occasions, (Lk 9:21, Mk 9:9, Lk 22:18, Jn 13:21) and the angels wanted the women to understand how this was all part of God�s plan. His death was no accident but intended just as his resurrection. The angel�s wanted the women�s faith not to be emotional but based on Jesus� own words that had now been fulfilled. From this we can see how important it is to remember the word of God and hold onto the word of God in our daily lives. Life can be understood as a series of experiences, some our ordinary, others pleasurable and exciting and others traumatic and difficult. If we allow our understanding of life to influenced only by our experiences we will go up and down, tossed about on the waves of life. To have faith in God and build our lives on the foundation of Jesus� resurrection means holding to the word of God and remembering what Jesus has already taught us.

The women reported what all these things to the Eleven but it seemed to them like nonsense. Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb, then he went away wondering to himself what had happened. Again it is interesting to see that even Peter who so wanted to see Jesus wondered to himself, rather than remembering Jesus� words. Jesus had very directly told him �The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day raised to life.� (Lk 9:22) But instead of remembering and thinking well of course the tomb should be empty he is bemused. We cannot learn faith in Jesus� resurrection by wondering to ourselves but by remembering and accepting the word of God. This is a theme that runs throughout the next account.

Look at verse Look at verse 13. �Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.� The two disciples were not from the eleven apostles. Verse 17 says that their faces were downcast. In their discussion with Jesus, whom they were kept from recognizing, we learn that these two had believed that he was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. They had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. But their hope had been crushed. The chief priests and the rulers had handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him. Jesus was dead. They thought it was the end of the story. But to their amazement, some of their women had been to the tomb and said that they had seen a vision of angels, who said Jesus was alive.

What is striking about these two is the amount they do know. They had been told the testimony of the women, they had learned about the empty tomb, and the declaration of the angels that Jesus has risen, they even mentioned that it is the third day (21) suggesting they had expected something to happen, but still they were walking away from Jerusalem downcast. They have all the knowledge that points to Jesus� resurrection but they are faithless. Can this also be our situation? We can know about Jesus resurrection, but still be downcast, we have no real power that enables us to believe and expect and have hope that enables us to see through the darkness, gloom, or fear of our situation.. Why is this? Perhaps we can find the answer in Jesus� words to the men. 

Look at verses 25, 26. �He said to them, �How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?�� And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, Jesus explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.� Jesus points to two problems the men have: first, they are slow to believe the prophets and second they did not want to accept that Christ had to suffer before entering glory. Their problem came from not fully understanding or accepting God�s words. They had had hope in the messiah, but not the messiah described in the Bible but their own idealistic idea. They had hope Jesus would redeem Israel, kick out the Romans and be a victorious success. They had hoped to share in his glory instead he had been arrested and crucified. So how does help them, he helps them to understand the Scriptures more deeply. He teaches about the Messiah from Moses and all the prophets. 

This is the moment where we all wish we could have been in on Jesus� bible study! We will never know what he said to them, but what we do know is that all Scripture either implicitly or explicitly points to Jesus Christ and his salvation. From the beginning of man�s sin in Ge 3:15 when God promised to send the offspring of the woman to crush Satan�s head, to the sacrifice hinted at when God prevented Abraham from sacrificing his son, through to the pass over lamb of Exodus and the sacrificial system established in Leviticus. Last week we saw Jesus graphically portrayed in Isaiah as the silent lamb pierced for our transgressions (Isa 53) and in the Psalms as the Christ whose hands and feet are pierced and who is mocked and whose clothes are divided (Ps 22). There are so many references to Jesus in Daniel 9, Zec 12, Micah and Malachai all of which Jesus could have opened to them. Throughout Old Testament Scripture, the Messiah as the suffering servant, as the sacrificial lamb is pointed to, the one who is crushed for our iniquities, and despised and rejected not some kind of unopposed humanistic success story.

�Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?� Jesus wanted them to have a full understanding that his death was no accident but the fulfillment of all Scripture. He wanted them to understand suffering comes before glory, that they should not be downcast but be looking ahead to God�s redemptive work. Without death there can be no resurrection. Next time we find ourselves downcast because of suffering, let�s remember the Jesus we are following, the Jesus who suffered but the Jesus who is now raised from the dead. Let�s hold onto his words, listen to his gentle rebuke and look forward to sharing in his glory. 

Look at verse 32, �They asked each other, �Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?� This verse gives us a vision of what Bible study should be, the word of God transforming downcast, disappointed, fearful men into men whose hearts are burning. The transformation comes not from a superficial solution to our problems, but from a deep faith in God�s word. We can understand why Jesus kept them from recognizing him until the last minute, he wanted the room for them to properly understand the word of God rather than get carried away by the emotion of his appearance. We see later in verse 44, even when he shows them he is bodily resurrected, he tells all his disciples, He said to them, �This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.� Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.�

Third, Evidence of the Resurrection through Jesus himself.

While the disciples were talking about Jesus� resurrection, Jesus appeared among them and said, �Peace be with you.� The disciples were startled and frightened thinking they saw a ghost. Jesus told them, �Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? Look at verse 39. �Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.� Jesus showed them the wounds in his hands and in his feet. Yet the disciples still didn�t believe it because of joy and amazement. So Jesus asked them, �Do you have anything here to eat?� Then he ate a piece of broiled fish in their presence. Through this he proved that he had risen not just in spirit but bodily. He is the first fruit of our resurrection.

Fourth, You are witnesses of these things

Jesus talked about the future work of God after this. Look at verses 46-47. �He told them, �This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.� Through Jesus� death and resurrection the way of salvation for all people was opened. Salvation comes through the repentance and forgiveness of sins in Jesus� name. To whom will this news be preached? �To all nations�. The recipients of this news are all nations. The gospel of Jesus started from Jerusalem where Jesus died and rose again and will be preached to all nations over the five oceans and six continents. 

�You are witnesses of these things.� The disciples were to go out to the world and be witnesses of all these things. They were to preach the gospel that Jesus died on the cross and rose again from the dead in three days in order to give all peoples the forgiveness of sins, salvation, eternal life and God�s blessing. �You are witnesses of these things.� These words of Jesus speak to believers in every generation. It was the reason why he came, that repentance and forgiveness of sins is preached to all people. In outreach yesterday I spoke to one guy who said faith should remain personal. I pointed him to this passage and explained that is certainly not Jesus� idea. There are many aspects to our life of faith, and also church life, there is the study of God�s word, there is the joy of worshipping, singing and praising God, there is the fellowship of believer�s as a ministry we pray for a loving spiritual community, there is our personal prayer life. Everyone has different gifts, of teaching, preaching, encouragement, healing, we have different strengths and weaknesses, but all of us should share the consuming concern to witness to Jesus. Jesus simply came to save the world through his death and resurrection, it is only through repentance and forgiveness can a person meet God, and it is only when he gospel is preached that this can happen. Being a witness to Jesus isn�t a side option, one of many choices as a Christian can involve themselves with witnessing to Jesus binds every believer to Jesus� central concern. Whatever else we do, let�s pray that God may enable us to witness to Jesus� gospel.  
How could the weak disciples serve this great work of God? Look at verse 49. �I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.� Jesus promised that he would send what God had promised. This means the Holy Spirit, the spirit of power from heaven. We cannot be witnesses in our own strength, we need to pray and be filled with the Holy Spirit. 
Look at verses 50-54. �When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.� Let�s pray
