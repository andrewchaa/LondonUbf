2010 Acts 6
STEPHEN, THE FIRST MARTYR

Acts 6:1-7:60
Key verse: 7:60
'Then he fell on his knees and cried out, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them.' When he had said this, he fell asleep.'

Today we see the continued growth of the church and the appointment of Stephen. In particular we see his defensive message of the Christian faith and his martyrdom. Stephen's death appears to have had a profound impact on the Apostle Paul and became a bridge for the mission to the gentiles as the earlier believers were forced to scatter. Stephen's message is given more space than any other speech or message in the whole book. He died for the truth that we are about to learn about. Through today's message, may God help us learn the faith of Stephen who was full of faith and the Holy Spirit.

Look at verse 1: 'In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Grecian Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.' In those days the number of disciples was increasing. Reference to 'disciples' (mathetes in Greek meaning learner or pupil) is repeated around 200 times in the four gospels. It refers not only to the 12 disciples but to all Christians who believes in Jesus. As the early church grew problems began to arise. One of the first was cultural and ethnic tension between the Hebraic Jews and the Grecian Jews. The early church began with the Hebraic Jews centred around the 12 apostles. As a result the culture was based on Jewish tradition. But there were many Jews who were scattered in the province of Greece who would return. Among them many became believers. Some think they separated along language lines just as we see later a Hellenistic synagogue in Jerusalem and a Hebraic synagogue (Ac 6:9). The early church collected money and food for the poor but it seems that as the number of believers grew the Grecian widows missed out on the daily distribution of food. This was probably accidental but tension grew on cultural and ethnic lines. Today there are various nationalities here. God has worked to bring many together in this room. Cultural difference and misunderstanding is inevitable. But here the tensions were in danger of disrupting the early church and causing a set back in the gospel. Complaint or as the KJV says, 'murmuring arose'. Murmuring is always deadly. With a murmuring attitude they spread discontent throughout the whole body of Christians. You murmur when you complain about a problem, but not to the one who can do something about it. In this case, it caused dissension throughout the whole congregation. The church was now under attack from within. It's one of the devil's favourite tricks to divide Christians. Many a church has been made useless by inner complaint, discontent and strife that has not been properly dealt with. It creates division and schisms.
 
It was a time of crisis. So how did the church to solve this problem? Look at verse 2-4: 'So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, 'It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables. Brothers, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.' The twelve apostles gathered all the disciples together and said that it would not be right for them to neglect the ministry of the word in order to wait on tables. Here 'wait on the tables' refers to the relief work of helping the poor. They said that is was not right for them to use their time and energy in this. This does not mean that 'helping the poor' is not important. Jesus taught them to wash one another's feet and serve one another. The problem was that they would neglect what they should be doing. It meant they needed a division of labour. The primarily mission as commanded by Jesus was to make disciples of all nations and to teach them everything that Jesus had commanded them. The apostles decided not to spend their time and energy in relief work but put prayer and the ministry of the word as their first priority. They would still help the poor by appointing the seven. 

Here we can see the basic direction among leaders within a church or mission. Such servants should not dissipate their energy but give their attention to prayer and the word of God. First prayer. Notice in verse 4 the disciples say they will give their attention to prayer and the ministry of the word. Notice that prayer is mentioned before the word. Satan is fearful of the person who kneels before God. Even if we are weak Christians, Satan fears prayer. It tells us that most of all an evangelist must be praying person. No matter how able he is a man cannot do anything if God does not help him. Only by praying to God can we do God's work. We know very well that prayer is important not only to church leaders but also to all believers. But in reality many people resent prayer. They do not pray regularly and cannot pray by faith with heart even for a short time. Real prayer takes perseverance and faithfulness. Such prayer bears fruit. W. Harney describes seeing a woman: 'I saw a female Christian with no legs and only with one arm. She was a seriously disabled woman. But she always praised God out of joy. Amazingly, she supported 5 people. I asked her how she could do. She answered that she could do 'by prayer and by faith.''  Matthew 7:7-8 say, 'Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.' I pray that we may give attention to prayer.

Second, the ministry of the word of God. The ministry of the word of God is to interpret it well, teach and to preach. It is a serious sin to wrongly interpret the word of God or teach it incorrectly. Such actions are the way of cults.  James 'the Martyr' Guthrie said, 'I was more fearful of standing on a preacher's podium than on the gallows.' Handling the word of God correctly is of life saving importance. Those who are responsible for the word of God should preach the word to all while struggling to find the exact meaning. The apostles made a decision to give their attention to prayer and the ministry of the word of God. 

Look at verse 5: 'This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch a convert to Judaism'. These are all Greek names. We don't know if they were all Greek but it shows that they considered the Grecian Jews and seem to have chosen them from the complaining party. This ended the dissension. The disciples presented these men to the apostles and they prayed and laid their hands on them (6). Their position in the church is often thought to be that of deacons.

When the seven deacons took responsibility for helping the poor and dealing with the practical administration the apostles gave their attention to prayer and the ministry of the word of God. What was the result? Look at verse 7: 'So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.' The word of God grew stronger. The word of God spread and the number of believers increased. Some has estimated the church to be around 20-25,000 believers at this point. Until now there is no record of a priest becoming a believer ' even at the time of Jesus ministry. But now the gospel was breaking through into the priesthood.

From verse 8 we read of Stephen. The meaning of 'Stephen' is 'crown'. It seems he was the crown of the early church! He was full of God's grace and power and did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people. Verse 3 says that he was full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom and verse 5 says that he was full of faith and the Holy Spirit. These expressions reveal his spiritual qualities. He did great wonders and miraculous signs. Though the wonders and miraculous signs are not recorded in detail but we can guess that they were similar to things done by Jesus and the apostles. He was a Grecian Jew who seems to have had a wider worldview than the Hebraic Jews. So much so that according to verse 9 he preached to the Freedmen. This synagogue was founded by Jews who had been slaves in the Roman empire and had later been set free. Then there were two groups from Africa: the synagogues of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and from the Roman provinces of Cilicia and Asia.

Some began to argue with Stephen. The capital of Cilicia is Tarsus from where Saul was from and perhaps he was the one who led the attack. But they could not stand up against his wisdom or the Spirit by whom he spoke (10). Having failed in argument they secretly persuaded some men to speak against Stephen saying, 'We have heard Stephen speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God.'(11) They stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin. The false witnesses claimed that Stephen never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law. They said that he said that Jesus of Nazareth would destroy the temple and change the customs Moses handed down to them. They chose to misunderstood Stephen's Biblical message. 

It was a tense moment. Yet how was Stephen in front of the Sanhedrin? Look at verse 15: 'All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.' Stephen did not have any hatred toward those who falsely accused him. He was not bitter against those who had plotted against him. Rather he forgave them and had compassion on them. There is peace and joy in those who forgive others and have mercy on others. 

The high priest questioned Stephen and asked 'Are these charges true?' Now Stephen had probably said something very similar to what was alleged but it was impossible for him to answer with a simple "Yes," or "No". He had said something about Jesus' coming and that the worship of the temple being changed. He had said that the customs that Moses had given would be altered. But he wanted to make clear what he meant. Therefore there follows, in Chapter 7, the longest sermon in the book of Acts. It is Stephen's brilliant defence of what he believed, and is really a review of the history of the people of Israel. Far from being blasphemous and disrespectful of God's word he actually honoured it. 

He speaks broadly of 4 things. First the testimony about Abraham (7:1-7). In this he reminds them that the promise of salvation is not by law but by faith. The Jews thought God revealed Himself through the Law. They held absolutely to Moses' law. They believed that they could have a right relationship with God and be saved by keeping the law. To this Stephen reminded them of Abraham who was before Moses. Look at verse 2-8. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, Ur of Chaldeans. God had appeared to Abraham not because he was a good man who deserved this. Rather it was entirely because of God's sovereign will. God promised that he would make his name great and make him a blessing. God gave him no inheritance in the promised land while he was alive. But God promised this old man who at this point had no child, that his descendants after him would possess the land. God said that Abraham's descendants would be strangers in a country not their own, and they would be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years. It is because God does not give man blessing prior to sufferings and difficulties. God's promise of salvation did not come from Moses but from Abraham. In other words, God first made a covenant relationship with Abraham and over 400 years later he gave the law to Moses. God revealed his plan gradually. But the Jews could not understand the progressive revelation of God. They misunderstood and thought that the Law of Moses was the final revelation of God. By testifying to Abraham's faith in God's promise he was reminding them that man cannot become righteous by deeds or through law but by faith: Just as Abraham became righteous when he believed in God's promise . 

Second, the testimony about Joseph (9-16). In speaking of this he reveals the shameful history of the Jews. Stephen reminded them that it was Jacob's sons, the patriarchs, who sold Joseph as a slave into Egypt because of their jealousy (9). How could brothers sell their own little brother to a Gentile nation as a slave! Joseph should have died as a slave in Egypt. But God was with Joseph even though his brothers deserted him. God rescued him from all his troubles and made him ruler over Egypt. Why does Stephen mention Joseph after Abraham? It was because he wanted to reveal their pride. In fact the Jewish people were nothing (Ex 1:5). They settled in Egypt at the time of Joseph and they increased while they lived as slaves. It was simply God's grace that they came out of Egypt and entered the land of Canaan. It was entirely by God's grace that they would exist at all. Stephen indirectly revealed that they killed Jesus and continued to persecute the church of God just as the patriarchs had sold Joseph. 

Third, the testimony about Moses (17-36). In speaking of this he reveals their sin of idolatry and of essentially their worship of Moses. The Israelites were persecuted by Egypt while they greatly increased in number. Newborn babies were being killed. But at that time Moses was born. Like all the others he was destined to be thrown into the river. But by God's wondrous sovereign will, he became the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He grew up as a prince within the palace. It was entirely God's grace that he became what he was. Yet when he wanted to do something for God all he ended up doing at the age of forty was to kill a man. Through his own effort the result was nothing but murder and rejection. He fled to Midian and lived as a shabby shepherd. He should have died as an exile. But after forty years in exile, God called him. He made him leader of Israel. The reason Stephen mentioned this familiar history was to tell the Sanhedrin that it was entirely by God's grace that Moses was used as the leader of Israel. But the Jews missed this. Their respect for Moses had become almost worship of him more than the God who gave him grace and used him. The religious leaders should see the God who used Moses rather than Moses. 

Fourth the warning of idolatry, particularly temple worship (37-50). Through verses 37-50 we can see God being with the Israelites. What an incredible grace! Yet the people made a golden calf and worshipped it (41). Furthermore they worshipped Molech (43), the god of Ammonites that demanded the sacrifice of children (Lev 18:21, Dt 18:10); they worshipped the star of Rephan (Saturn), the god of the Assyrians. Time and time again the people had rejected God. The origin of the temple was the Tabernacle ' the ancestors of the Israelites worshipped God in the tabernacle when they were in the desert (44). Later David wanted to build a temple but God refused but allowed his son to build it. Solomon built a magnificent temple but as Isaiah tells us, God cannot be confined in the temple. Heaven is his throne and the earth is his footstool (Isa 66:1,2). There is nothing that can hold God in the world. When there was no temple he was the God of glory (7:2). However later the Jews worshipped a temple and began to think of God only in a temple. Temple worship is no different from worshipping a golden calf. When the Jews worshipped the temple and Law as idols, they became hypocritical and their religious life became very rigid. They should accept Jesus Christ who is the true temple.

By speaking on these four points Stephen pointed out their persistent sin problem which their ancestors had also had. It was the persistent rejection of the Messiah. They rejected Moses who prophesied about the Messiah (39-43), they had rejected the prophets who had prophesied about the Messiah (52) and eventually they rejected the Messiah Jesus himself. In fact they did not keep the Law that God gave. While describing the history of Israel Stephen correctly diagnosed their chronic problem in verses 51-53: 'You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him' you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.' These Jews would understand "Stiff-necked" -- proud, stubborn, they would not bow their heads at all. The reason was that they were not circumcised in their hearts and ears. Though they were circumcised in their body they were not in their hearts. So they did not know the spiritual world but indulged themselves in the worship of the law and temple. In fact they were not the descendants of Abraham but were just religious people. 

The Jews had a great opportunity to admit their sins and repent. But how were they? What happened? Look at verse 54: 'When they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him.' The KJV says when they heard these things 'they were cut to the heart' and gnashed their teeth. Hearing Stephen's message, their hearts were struck and their consciences were pierced. But rather than repent they covered the voice of their conscience and became determined not to repent. They were furious and gnashed their teeth out of anger towards Stephen. It sounds a terrifying event. But Stephen was not intimidated or overwhelmed by such an atmosphere. Rather he was full of the Holy Spirit. When looking up to heaven, he saw the glory of God. And he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God. It seemed that Jesus was very happy with Stephen's message and was pleased with him. It was a really glorious vision. Out of amazement, he said,  'Look, I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God (56).' 

Look at verse 57-58a. At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. They stoned him viciously. Look at verses 59-60: 'While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.' Then he fell on his knees and cried out, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them.' When he had said this, he fell asleep.' While he was being stoned to death, he was praying for those who stoned him. Stephen, who prayed for his enemies, reminds us of Jesus who prayed on the cross 'Father forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing'. (Lk 23:34, 46). Although he was not an apostle he was a holy man who was like Jesus. Such compassion speaks of the incredible love of God and the amazing power of the Spirit to change the human heart. At this point the author, Luke, briefly mentions Saul giving approval to the death. It seems that Stephen's prayer for his enemies, even at the point of death, was what began to make Saul's heart crack. Paul was the fruit of Stephen's prayer. 

In conclusion, Stephen was an excellent bible teacher who logically defended the Christian faith from the Old Testament. His message of salvation by faith became Paul's theological thought. Most of all he had the heart and love of Christ. He was a holy martyr who prayed for his enemies who stoned him.  I pray that we may grow like Stephen who was an excellent bible teacher, being full of the Holy Spirit and faith. I pray that we may learn Jesus deeply so that we may be able to love even our enemies. May God help us serve intellectuals in our generation who reject the gospel with this love and earnest prayer.
