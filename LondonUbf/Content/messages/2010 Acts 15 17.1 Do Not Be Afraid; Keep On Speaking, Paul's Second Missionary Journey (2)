2010 Acts 15

DO NOT BE AFRAID; KEEP ON SPEAKING, Paul's second missionary journey (2)


Acts 17:1 ' 18:22
Key verse 18: 9-10
'One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.  For I am with you, and no-one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city.'

 In the last lecture, we learned how Paul pioneered Philippi ' the first European town ' after seeing the vision of a man from Macedonia. When Paul prayed and preached, the Holy Spirit worked in Lydia's heart and she became the first convert. Today's passage talks about how Paul's pioneering work in Europe grew. This second mission journey happened around A.D. 50-52 for 3 years. He was in his 50s yet he tirelessly worked and pioneered Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Athens and Corinth. Wherever he went, he came across obstacles, Europe was a spiritual battle field yet, by God's help, he won the spiritual battles. May God help us to learn through this passage Paul's gospel faith, pioneering spirit and trust in the Holy Spirit who was with him wherever he went. 

I. Pioneering Thessalonica, Berea and Athens (17:1-34) 

(1) Thessalonica (1-9) 

Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia and they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. Thessalonica was the capital of Macedonia. It was a prosperous city and important in military terms. Cicero in Rome called the city as the heart of Roman Empire. As he had done before, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. The essence of his message was Jesus' death and resurrection.

Look at verse 4. 'Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women.' Paul preached in the Jewish synagogue, yet many of those who were converted were God-fearing Greeks and a few prominent women. According to Acts 20:4, some people like Aristarchus and Secundus became the fruit of this preaching. Yet, the Jews became jealous. So they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.  But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting: "These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus." When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. Then they made Jason and the others pay bail and let them go.

(2) Berea (10-15) 

When they realised the seriousness of the situation, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. Berea was about 80 km south west from Thesalonica. How were the people of Berea? Look at verse 11. 'Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.' Bereans were pure and had a very good heart to receive the word of God. They also examined the Scripture. This means that they meditated on the meaning of the word deeply. What was the result of an attitude like this? Look at verse 12. 'Many of the Jews believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.' When they gave their attention to the word they came to believe and be saved. Here, we can see the importance of our attitude in receiving the word of God. Though the word is the same for each person, the result significantly differs according to our attitude. The Bible is the word of the living and almighty God. We should, therefore, be eager to read and examine the word. There is life in the word itself. In it, there is absolute truth. For us to grow in knowledge and understanding, we need to read many things ' newspapers, books and some religious books. Yet, most of all, we must read the Bible. We should always read the Bible with an examining attitude and allow our thinking to be changed by the Bible. 

When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, they went there, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. Here we can see how aggressive and persistent Satan is. Paul could have been upset and disappointed by these Jews. Yet, he saw the work of Satan and didn't fight back humanly. The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast and the men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens. 

(3) Athens (16-34) 

In Paul's time, Athens was the centre of religion, art, philosophy and all sorts of studies. In particular, it was the centre of Philosophy such as Epicurus and Stoic Philosophy. In the Epicurean view, the highest pleasure is tranquillity and freedom from fear. They regarded obtaining this tranquillity and freedom as the goal of life and thought that they could obtain these by abstaining from bodily desires. In the Stoic view, they valued reasoning and asceticism. People in Athens indulged in Philosophy and they sought after the latest new idea. Yet, spiritually, Paul saw the city is full of idols. He even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. During those days in Athens there were thousands of idols. Though Athens was the city of culture and Philosophy, the fact that there were so many idols in that city shows us that no matter whether one is learned or not if one doesn't know God, he can't but be lost in his sins. Paul shared God's heart and would have been distressed and saddened to find so many idols in the city. So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, "What is this babbler trying to say?" Others remarked, "He seems to be advocating foreign gods." They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus. There they said to him, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean." Paul used this opportunity to preach the gospel to the Greeks. He understood them well and explained the gospel from their perspective so that they could understand. 

He starts his message Look at verse 22-23, 'Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.' What one sees about Paul here is that before he preached to the people of Athens he first found out about them. He walked round the city, found out about their religion and even studied their poetry (28). He made an effort to be able to relate to them on their level. Paul struggled to be all things to all people. We need to learn From Paul and continually struggle to know and understand those who we are studying with or could potentially study with. 

Paul's message had three main points, first, he testified to the creator God who created all things and also human beings (24-26). Second, he preached that God is not an abstract God but he is with us always (27,28). Third, he urged them to believe in Jesus' death and resurrection and turn back to God (29-31). He preached with all his heart. Yet, people whose hearts were already proud due to their philosophical knowledge could not accept Paul's message, verse 32 says that 'some of them sneered at him.' Here we can see that those who only regard the word of God as knowledge can never be saved nor be born again. Nevertheless, a few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others. 

II. Pioneering Corinth  (18:1-22) 

After leaving Athens, Paul reached Corinth. Corinth was a port city and a centre of trade. In the centre of this city, there was a temple of Venus in which there were over 1,000 prostitutes who would come down into the city at night. Unlike Athens, Corinth was a city of pleasure-seeking. Romans would go there to drink and fulfil there hedonistic desires. There Paul met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them. Just like Paul they were tent makers. They co-worked and also served the mission together. He was lay missionary. On every Sabbath, he preached the word to the Jews and Greeks.

Sometime later, Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia. At that time Paul was devoting himself exclusively to preaching and testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. He poured himself out in order to give this message to people. Young people these days are very clever. They are often busy and occupied with many things. They don't have much interest or room for the truth. If we preach the gospel to them with a casual attitude, they won't change all that will happen is that we will be hurt when they reject us. To win their hearts and turn them to God, we also need to have Paul's attitude and devote ourselves exclusively to the word of God. Enjoy the word and preach it with great enthusiasm. We should grow as excellent bible teachers like Paul and have passion for the word. 

Through Paul's preaching, Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized. When Paul exclusively devoted himself to the word of God, people in Corinth ' those who looked most unlikely to come to faith ' turned to God. Yet, once again, when there was the work of the Holy Spirit the Jews became jealous and opposed Paul and became abusive. Paul then shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clear of my responsibility. From now on I will go to the Gentiles." Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. 

Look at verse 9.'One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.' This verse shows us that Paul became fearful. Paul had been continually persecuted for the past 4 years by Jews. Stoned, flogged, put in jail, slandered, shouted at, several times he almost died. According to 1 Co 2:3, we see that Paul was in weakness and fear. According to the letter he sent to Thessalonica church, he was so worried because of the believers there that he almost became sick. (1 Thessalonians 2:17-3:5). One can imagine the persecution he must have faced from Jews when the synagogue ruler was converted. Paul must have wanted a spiritual break. At this time, what did God say to him? Did he say 'well done and have rest'? No. Look at verses 9-10.One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city.

First, he said do not be afraid because no one could harm him because God was with him. He had been continually persecuted but God says to him that no one could attack or harm him. 

Second, God commands him not to be silent but keep on speaking. Even in the time of persecution and the danger of death, God commands him not to be silent but keep on speaking and preaching the gospel. Here we can see God's heart to save one soul. God had compassion towards the people of Corinth. He wanted them to repent, believe the gospel and be saved. God wants all sinners to repent and be saved. He also tells each of us ' do not be afraid but keep on speaking. When we serve students, we will also be persecuted. Perhaps we are sneered at, mocked or even thrown off campus. At those times the temptation is to shut our mouths and hide. But, we should not be silent rather we must keep on speaking. Paul says in Rom 10:14,15. 'How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? 15And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news' When we shut our mouths we shut in the gospel. The gospel becomes like a beautiful caged bird that wants to fly around but is trapped, trapped in the cage it has no power and dies. We must keep speaking and release the gospel message.

Third, he says that he has many people in this city. In Paul's view it seemed that Corinth was only full of enemies. Yet, God says 'I have many people in this city.' This means that there were many people whom he has chosen in that city that would turn to him if and only if they hear the gospel. Often we think who can believe the gospel in this generation. Yet, God has already chosen many people. Therefore, we should not become silent but keep on speaking. Paul was greatly encouraged by God and stayed in Corinth for a year and half, preaching and teaching the word of God. While pioneering Corinth, he wrote Thessalonians.

Look at verse 12. 'While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him into court.' They charged Paul with persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law. Paul was in danger of being imprisoned again. At this, God worked in Gallio's heart. He thought the issue is purely religious and, as a result, nothing to do with him. At this, the Corinthian crowd who were against the Jews all turned on Sosthenes the synagogue ruler, who had brought Paul to the court. They beat him in front of the court. But Gallio showed no concern whatever. 

Paul's mission life is full of persecution and suffering. Yet ultimately, no one could harm him. His life was always full of life and power. If we avoid suffering and become complacent. We will in fact experience powerlessness and emptiness. We will become miserable. However, if we sacrifice our lives for God and his mission, we will live a powerful life ' receiving the power of the resurrection. We will live a truly victorious life like Paul. May God help us to actively serve students with life-giving words of God. May God help each of us also to live a life full of power and a real victory.

After serving Corinth, Paul then left the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because of a vow he had taken. He dropped by Ephesus and left Priscilla and Aquila there. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined, saying that he would do so if it is God's will. Then he set sail from Ephesus. When he landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch, from which he was sent.

In conclusion, Paul shared God's heart for the gentiles and devoted himself to bringing them to Jesus regardless of all the persecutions. However, even Paul became filled with fear. Yet, God who was with him gave him courage and faith to start again. God was with him all the time and never let him alone. He became Paul's protector, support and shield. He led his way and also moved people's hearts when he preached the gospel. The same God is with us. He says to us "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this university!" Therefore, we should not be afraid or be silent but keep on speaking the gospel truth and run our race of faith.
