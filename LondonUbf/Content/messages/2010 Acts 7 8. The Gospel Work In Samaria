THE GOSPEL WORK IN SAMARIA

Acts 8: 1-40
Key Verse: 8:4-5
'Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.  Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there,' 


In the last lecture we learned about Stephen the first martyr.  As Tertullian (155 AD ' 230AD) said, 'the blood of a martyr is the seed of the church'.  Stephen's martyrdom became the starting point of the expansion of the first church towards the world.  Verses 1-3 in today's passage talk about the persecution of the church in Jerusalem, beginning with Stephen's martyrdom.  Verses 4 ' 40 talk about the events as the gospel spread to Samaria through Philip.  Through today's passage I pray that we may see God's redemptive will which scattered the church and used the disciples to preach to the Samaritans and the gentiles through persecution. 

Look at verse 1.  'And Saul was there, giving approval to his death. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.' Saul did not lead the death of Stephen but he saw it and participated in it by giving his approval.  On the day Stephen died there came to be a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem.  The religious leaders who previously were too afraid of the crowd to persecute the church now began a great persecution.  Stephen's death was the beginning of the great persecution of Christianity as well as that of the expansion of Christianity.  What was the result of this persecution? 

All the believers except for the apostles were scattered across Judea and Samaria.  The disciples of Jesus received the command to preach in Jerusalem, Samaria, Judea and to the ends of the earth (1:8) but so far they had remained in Jerusalem.  If the church in Jerusalem grew continually and many Jews became Christians the gospel would have remained within Jerusalem and Judaism rather than achieving its global redemptive purpose. For this reason God used persecution to create a turning point for the church. The apostles had a martyr's spirit and remained in Jerusalem to protect the church.  

Look at verse 2. 'Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.' As Joseph of Aramathea had buried Jesus some godly Jews buried Stephen. Since Stephen's death they had become courageous and wanted to pay respect to him. Look at verse 3.  'But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.'  Saul who had just watched Stephen's death became the leader of the persecution. He tried to destroy the church (Ps 80:13). Saul hated the gospel, he thought it was right that Stephen was stoned witnessing to the gospel and he broke into peoples' houses to drag out the Christians, men and women alike.  His acts were cruel and evil so the church in Jerusalem faced a great hardship yet it was God's hand which scattered the church rather than allowing it to remain in Jerusalem. Through this the gospel work in Samaria and the gospel work in gentile areas, (13-28) began.  

The church has a world mission as a scattered church not only as a settled church.  Stephen's death and the persecution arising from it can be interpreted as God's stick to the comfortable church in Jerusalem which needed to scatter to carry out its duty elsewhere.  God struck the church in Jerusalem which was passive and limited and changed it from a settled church to a scattered church fulfilling Jesus' world mission command (1:8) and the beginning of the gentile salvation ministry which was prophesied by many Old Testament prophets.  It was the first trumpet sound of Christianity's world mission history.  

Look at verse 4.  'Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.' The Christians were scattered but they went not only to Samaria but also as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch (11:19).  They were not fearful refugees, saddened and fallen into unbelief, instead they preached the gospel and the fire of the Holy Spirit spread out from Jerusalem.  As the spark becomes a new fire the fire of the Holy Spirit spreads out from Jerusalem.  This passage introduces Philip's gospel work; he was the second deacon after Stephen. Look at verse 5. 'Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there.'  Philip was a bible teacher who was filled with the Holy Spirit and the word.  He knew that Samaria, where the Jews refused to go, needed the gospel, so he went there and preached Christ. 

Samaria was founded in the division of Israel after King Solomon's death.  Initially it was ruled by Jeroboam who began the worship of a golden calf in Bethel and Dan and led the Northern Kingdom away from worshipping God.  Later, after the Assyrian conquest (800 BC) gentiles came to live in the land and the Samaritans had intermarried.  Since then the Jews had despised them, but now, to those who since that time had lost their faith a way was opened for salvation. Through God's sovereign will Philip went to Samaria.  God used him first to preach in Samaria then sent two apostles from Jerusalem, Peter and John, so that the churches in Jerusalem and Samaria could be united.  

How did Philip conduct his ministry? Look at verse 6, 'When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said.'  He preached the word about Christ and performed miracles too.  Then the crowd followed his words and because, rather than following the signs they believed the word of God he preached many were baptised. Evil spirits who possessed many people left with shrieks whilst many paralytics and cripples were healed; because of this there was great joy in the city. The driving out of demons and the ministry of healing were things which were promised to all believers not just the apostles.   These miracles were characteristic of the time of the apostles.

Philip's Samaritan evangelism was very successful, the city was filled with joy because of the healing of many demon possessed people and the sick.  The joy may have been simply because of the healings but ultimately this is unsatisfying. The gospel gives people inner conflict for a while but the result is the great joy which comes from the solution of our fundamental problem, we come to enjoy freedom and happiness which come from peace with God.

Luke introduces Simon in order to explain more specifically what Philip did.  Simon had for a long time performed magic and amazed all the Samaritans.  He boasted that he was someone great. So 'all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, this man is the divine power known as the Great Power.'  We don't know what his magic was but probably it was healing the sick and driving out demons from people or prophesying through astrology.  Simon deceived people, telling them his magic was the divine power of God.  Unbelievers who have not received the light of the Holy Spirit, judge according to their dark hearts and are confused about the difference between Satan's false power and God's power. The Samaritans, not only the lowly people but also the intellectual elite believed that Simon's magic was the divine power of God.  Like all false teachers Simon boasted that he was somebody and this had continued for a long time. Simon had a solid foundation in Samaria; it would not have been easy for the gospel to work so powerfully in a city so influenced by magic. But Philip because he was full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom (6:3) enjoyed a great harvest when he preached the gospel there. 

Look at verse 12, 'But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women.' Philip's evangelism in Samaria overcame Simon's powerful influence, the Samaritans who were deceived by Simon's magic, heard the gospel of truth and came back to true faith.  Before the truth of the gospel false human magic was subdued, many men and women believed and were baptised.  Simon the magician believed too.  This one sentence shows the success of Philip's Samaritan ministry, if Simon's followers became Christians and finally the highly influential Simon was changed too it means that almost all the city was changed.  Simon followed Philip everywhere; amazed at Philip's signs and miracles.  But when we see that he tried to buy the power of the Holy Spirit it does not seem that he really believed. It seems instead that he was fascinated by Philip's power and followed him.  It is almost always the case that when a person comes to Christianity because of miracles he does not accept the gospel easily. People who are impressed by miracles have great curiosity and self indulgent desires.  Such people easily return to the world unless they humbly receive the word of God. Because Simon performed false magic he could see that Philip had a true ability to perform miracles. Philip's miraculous power was fundamentally different to Simon's magic. 

Look at verse 14. The apostles who remained in Jerusalem heard about Philip's Samaritan ministry and sent two apostles. Peter and John's visit as the representatives of the church shows the true spirit of the gospel overcoming the prejudice between the Jews and the Samaritans.  Jesus earlier forbade the apostles from evangelising Samaria yet when the time came the Holy Spirit sent the apostles there.  We can see the apostles going out to the gentiles because of the Jews' rejection. They went down and prayed for the Samaritans to receive the Holy Spirit, the two apostles laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit (17).  Perhaps they had spoken in tongues and prophesied as external evidence of the Holy Spirit because Simon reacted by offering the apostles money and saying 'Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.' (19). He thought the power of the Holy Spirit could be sold and bought with money. Through this we can see that he did not receive the Holy Spirit and his following Philip was not based on true faith but Simon's material benefit. Simon was like a secular believer.  A secularist serves himself through a religious lifestyle rather than serving God.  To Simon God was not the purpose of life but a means to an end.  God is the purpose of our lives and the greatest enemy of a person is himself.  Self denial is the most fundamental and important thing to follow Jesus.  

Peter rebuked him sternly. Verses 20 ' 23 'Peter answered: May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God. Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.'  When Peter rebuked Ananias he died immediately now for Simon the only way to live was to repent. ''repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord.' Peter's rebuke was not to curse him but to help him repent, at this Simon answered, 'pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.' His words were more to avoid Peter's rebuke than repentance. He needed to obey Peter, repent and pray for himself. Look at verse 25 'When they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.' The two apostles finished their mission and returned to Jerusalem, on their way they preached the gospel in many Samaritan villages, they knew that the most important mission was preaching the gospel.  In the past when they could not overcome their Jewish prejudice against Samaria they wanted to bring down fire on the Samaritans but now they preached to them with joy.  

Look at verse 26 'Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Go south to the road' the desert road' that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.'  Now a new ministry is introduced, separate from the Samaritan ministry. An angel of the Lord appeared to Philip.  The angel of the Lord indicates God's direct presence and direction of the work. Luke demonstrates that Philip's gentile ministry was led directly by God.  The angel of the Lord told Philip who was serving the Samaritan ministry with all his heart to go south to the desert road from Jerusalem to Gaza.  It was not Philip's idea but a direction which Philip received from the angel of the Lord. In spite of this, this direction included some practical challenges if he was to obey it. 

First he had to stop what he was doing in the middle of a flourishing Samaritan ministry. Second he had to go to a desert where no one lived; but Philip being filled with the Holy Spirit obeyed and started towards the south. On his way he saw a chariot on the road. The chariot was that of an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians.  He had been to Jerusalem to worship and was going back.  It is over 1500km from Ethiopia to Jerusalem and one had to travel for about a month on the desert road, but the eunuch had come that long distance to worship, he was a man of great spiritual desire. When Philip approached the chariot he heard the eunuch reading the book of the prophet Isaiah.  Look at verse 29 'The Spirit told Philip, Go to that chariot and stay near it.' The Holy Spirit gave him a specific direction so Philip obeyed and ran up to the chariot, he had the attitude of a gospel preacher. Philip asked him, 'Do you understand what you are reading and the eunuch answered, 'How can I unless someone explains it to me?' and he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. He was a humble person; in order to learn the Bible he invited lowly Philip into his chariot.  A humble person is not characterised by good manners but by a desire to learn from others.  This man was a high official but he was willing to learn from Philip. When Philip sat with him the eunuch was reading Isaiah 53, which was the most direct prophesy about the messiah in the Old Testament.  He was reading this passage 'He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth. In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.' The eunuch asked, 'tell me please who is the prophet talking about? Himself or someone else? He must have known the legend that Isaiah was sawn in two by King Manasseh.  So he could have thought that the prophet prophesied about his own death or that he was referring to Israel as the suffering servant. At this Philip taught beginning with that very passage and told him the good news about Jesus.  He taught that the person prophesied in Isaiah 53 was the messiah Jesus who died for our sins and rose again.

The eunuch accepted the gospel and wanted to be baptised to affirm his decision to be a Christian. They stopped at some water and Philip baptised him. When they came up out of the water, the spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away and he disappeared. He came to this eunuch according to the Holy Spirit's leading and again went away according to the Holy Spirit.  Even though Philip disappeared the eunuch was filled with joy and went on his way. According to the law a eunuch could not enter the assembly of God's people but in the New Testament era an emasculated gentile can participate in eternal life without discrimination. Luke emphasises this point by recording this event in detail. After that Philip appeared in Azotus which is a city 20 km away from Gaza and travelled about preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.  

In conclusion, we can learn three things.  First, God accomplishes his work, even through persecution. The purpose of the church is world mission, preaching the gospel to the ends of the earth. For this purpose we serve, we preach, we teach, we rebuke, we encourage and we raise people. If we settle down and seek to focus only on ourselves God scatters us. The saints in Jerusalem would not have been able to understand the will of God as they fled from persecution, leaving their towns and families to live as strangers in foreign lands.  Yet the reason God gave them difficulty for a while was so that he could accomplish his greater will which is world mission.  Second the leader of the gospel work is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was with Philip and revealed his power through him. The Holy Spirit led him very sensitively in helping the Ethiopian eunuch.  Like Philip we are instruments, may God help us to understand that the Holy Spirit is leading the gospel work and obey his leading. Third Philip was a prepared Bible teacher.  The Holy Spirit is the leader of the ministry but he also needs people as his co-workers, he needs people who are prepared and obedient to his call.  Philip was full of the word and faith and was humble. The Holy Spirit could use him freely, may we grow as prepared Bible teachers like Philip and be used preciously by the Holy Spirit.
