FAITH THAT OVERCOMES THE WORLD

1John 5:1-21
Key verses 5:4-5
“…for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.”

We come to the end of 1 John. We have moved fairly quickly through the letter and as mentioned at the start John is a mender. He wants to mend the false teaching and false thinking that are creeping into the church. He has outlined the nature of authentic Christianity so that we can identify a true Christian. This is not just so that we can identify error that might come in but also so that we know where we stand against the test of what is a true believer. Are you a true believer? How do you know? Can we be sure? John has circled these issues again and again throughout his letter and sums up the vital signs of life: Faith in Jesus Christ; love for others; and obedience to God's commandments. But for the first time he then adds another – that we overcome the world. Look at verse 5: ‘Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.’ This is challenging. Most want to do well yet very often we live with a sense of defeat. For example when we fail in exams, when we don’t get promotion, when we don’t see the spiritual fruit we hoped for or simply when we struggle to survive. In failure we can feel sorrowful even bitter. And because of a sense of defeat we live a life of timidity. Yet John speaks here of a victorious life. Believers overcome the world. May God help us to find this victory in Christ. 

I. Our faith (1-12)
Look at verses 1-2: “Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands.”  John here is summarising the 3 tests for a believer: the faith or truth test, the love test and the obedience or righteousness test. In health doctors are always checking for the right signs of life and by comparing someone with what should happen they can see when there is a problem. The very first test given to newborn baby is called the ‘Apgar score’. It’s a test designed to quickly evaluating newborn baby’s physical condition immediately after delivery to determine whether any immediate medical care is required. It looks at things like muscle tone, heart rate, reflexes, skin colour, breathing rate and the like. On birth the vital signs are essential. Sam when he was born was a funny colour and his breathing needed sorting out – he had a low score and so got treatment. In the same way a child of God can have a spiritual Apgar score! John has been giving us three vital signs of new birth.

First the faith/truth test. Look at verse 1a: ‘Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God’ (1). Through belief we become a child of God. As we have seen throughout the letter clear faith in Jesus as the Christ is the starting point to a life of faith. The condition to be a child of God is simply that we confess that Jesus is the Christ. Second the love test in verse 1b: ‘everyone who loves the father loves his child as well’ (1). When we believe Jesus, we are born again and open our spiritual eyes and come to see who God is. The result is that we come to love Him. Just as children come to love their earthly parents and then grow to love their siblings so those who are spiritually born grow to love their heavenly father and their brothers and sisters in the faith. Third the obedience/righteousness test in verse 2: ‘This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands.’ We tend to think of love as a feeling but as John has been telling us loving God is keeping his commands (3a).  John has circled these three tests again and again throughout the letter and here summarises them. I will not repeat what they all mean but you recall that this does not mean a perfect life or that we suddenly become perfect in these areas but rather as John has been saying a believer should grow in these areas. 

He then adds to this a challenging truth in verse 3 “and his commands are not burdensome” (3b). Really? Is this true? As Paul said to the Peter the law was a ‘yoke that neither we nor our fathers could bear’ – God’s commands were burdensome! (Ac 15:10). Yet John is speaking of a change of heart. Whatever we do, if we do it unwillingly or reluctantly then it becomes a real burden to us. In the past Joseph did not like the piano and so hardly practised and that is despite his mother’s repeated requests! But more recently he has started to enjoy it and all 3 kids often like to practice and show off what they have learnt. When we love it becomes far easier. Jacob worked for Laban for 7 years like a slave. Nobody would say that it was not burdensome. Yet because he loved Rachel, 7 years seemed like a few days to him (Gen 29:20). At times, we feel burdened by God and his commands. This is a sign that we have grown cold in our love for him and forgotten who is asking. Without love God’s commands are hard and we resent them. When we love money more than God we find God’s command to be generous and to give hard. When we want to live according to our sinful nature the word of God, especially in the areas of sexual morality, becomes burdensome and 1:1 bible study becomes a heavy burden. Yet when we realize that such things cannot bring us real happiness and real peace but rather tend to imprison and lead us from Christ we repent and the word of God again becomes the word of grace that gives us life and joy. In short we cannot obey without love.

Yet let’s face it. Life is a struggle and there is a tension between the world and our faith. At times we might think that the world is stronger and will overcome us. At times the life of faith can feel like a burden that we cannot bear. There is huge pressure in this world to cave in and live like everyone else. When young it’s called peer pressure but when older it’s there and we feel the pressure and strain of the world in our work, families and life. Life can seem like a battle at times. We look at our lives and those around us – perhaps those of believers who are failing - and think ‘Can I last? Can I stand to the end?’ Yet here John tells us we can be confident. Having repeated the signs of a believer John adds a particularly special note that is only found at the start of this last chapter. Look at verses 4-5 “for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.” This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. Three times John repeats the word ‘overcome’. The word overcome in Greek is ‘nikao’ means triumph or victory. It’s where we get the word Nike and there was even a Greek god of victory called Nike. John is telling us a believer should be an overcomer. A believer overcomes the world. So how can we overcome the world?

First, the root of victory against the world is found only in God. Notice in both verses 1 and 4 the phrase ‘born of God’ is repeated. Everyone born of God overcomes the world (4). This tells us that without being born of God we cannot overcome the world. Nicodemus was someone who struggled hard to be at the top – a Pharisee and member of the Jewish ruling council. He seemed to have overcome. He was wealthy, powerful, religious and moral. Yet despite his worldly success the lack of peace and joy as well as a lack of spiritual power meant he knew something was missing which he could not overcome himself. There was no kingdom of God in his heart and Jesus said to him you must be born again (John 3.3). In order to overcome the world we must be ‘born of God’. The world without God is one of materialism and selfishness. The world without God tends to be cold and only the strong survive. Therefore in order to survive this world it is natural that people become selfish and greedy. So how can we overcome this world? If God does not help us we simply cannot overcome this world. We must be born of God. 

But is this right? Surely some people lead victorious lives? Yet even here when we judge our lives on the worldly value system there are only a few can really claim to be successful and overcome. This is because most live by comparing themselves to others and as a result often live with a sense of failure. People compare themselves with others. They compare and seek happiness in their income, job title, number of bible students and the like. As a result of such comparison many are held by a sense of failure and live timid lives. I remember Moses talking of the competitive University system in Korea. People try hard to get into a University. When they don’t they feel a sense of failure. But he then said when you talk to those who do get into university they say ‘Ahh yes. But it’s not a good university’. But then those in a good university say, ‘Ahh yes. But it’s not SNU’. And then those in SNU say, ‘Ahh yes. but I am not on a good course. It’s a marginal subject’. And then those on good courses say ‘Ahh yes. But I am really low down in the class and far from the top’. By nature we compare – mothers going to school compare their children and their lives. People compare their houses, their income, their jobs, their cars, their clothes, their intelligence. The list is endless. Such comparison drives us into a sense of competition and leads to fatalism and timidity. Basically few can even really claim to overcome. But what about those who do? Even the most successful in the end face death and often live with a sense of failure. Some talk of this as ‘destination sickness’ - that for those who overcome and arrive they feel let down and disappointed with what they've achieved. Solomon gained everything yet he realised, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise? For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise man too must die!” (Ecc 2:15-16). No matter how successful someone may be if they cannot overcome sin and death their lives end in failure. Julius Caesar famously said “I came I saw I conquered”. Yet his end was to be assassinated by Brutus. And of course after death we face the judgement of a holy God. 

Apostle John was convinced only those with faith can overcome the world. And this is not just a few people – look again at verse 4 “for everyone born of God overcomes the world’. What does everyone mean? It means everyone. All believers overcome! Yet despite this promise people think that if we live by faith in this world we will be failures. Some think that if they devote too much to God they will lose out. Yet when we really live by faith we can overcome. It is because the Almighty creator God is responsible for our lives. In order to be successful in this world we have to have ability, knowledge and know many people. Yet those born of God come to have the Almighty God as our rock, our guarantee and our supporter and through him we can live a victorious life. 

So does this mean that all believers will come top of everything and gain all they want? Will they have perfect victory at school, in work and in ministry? No. God does bless and God is generous and he does give generously to his children. But when John is talking about the world he is really talking about something far more than just worldly stuff and possessions. He is primarily referring to the invisible spiritual system of evil and is saying that as a Christian we can overcome that. He is saying that as believers we overcome the world with the cravings of sin, the lust of the eyes and boasting of what we have and do (1 Jn 2:16). In short he is saying that it is possible to overcome the pressure of life. It is possible to overcome the pull and temptation to cave in. But how? John says it is by faith – that’s all. Verse 5 ‘Only he who believes that Jesus is the son of God’. This is not faith from years ago when we first believed but faith right now. The word ‘overcome’ is in the present tense and indicates continually overcoming moment by moment.

Ray Steadman gives a great example of how this looks. Remember the account in Exodus 17 when Israel was moving out of Egypt - they came to the desert and the Amalekites came against them and fought with them at Rephidim? The battle was fierce. All the forces of Israel were engaged in fighting this ruthless enemy. Until Moses went on the mountainside and took his staff of God and lifted it up they were losing. But when Moses stood with his arm and staff extended and as long as he could hold up his arms the battle went for Israel. But when Moses' arm grew tired and he gradually let it come down the tide of battle turned and the Amalekites began to conquer. Despite all the fighting of Israel they began to lose. Clearly it became apparent that the issue of the battle did not lie with the fighting of Israel but in the dependence on the power of an invisible God. The staff of God was the symbol of dependence upon the power of God. Only when this was lifted up toward the heavens he found that Israel began to prevail against the Amalekites. Their fighting was then of value and it accomplished something. This is a picture of the battle that you and I are engaged in. How do we win? Well, the issue does not lie in our fighting. Yes we do need to fight. We do need to pray, and read the bible, and study God's Word. We need to apply it in every situation. We need to put on the whole armour of God when the enemy comes against us. But none of this is of any use unless we are recognizing that it is the life of God within us that makes the difference. It is Jesus who wins. It is Jesus who overcomes. Our dependence is on his activity in us. When we do that, it is a different story. 

Do you want victory?  Don’t look to yourself.  Don’t look to your attainments.  Don’t look to your past records.  Don’t look to your membership of UBF.  Look to Jesus.  Do you know what an air-shot is in golf?  It’s when you swing the golf club but you miss the ball.  I don’t play but I imagine it’s embarrassing.  Do you know what the problem is?  A lack of talent for one thing!  But the principle problem is that you take your eye of the ball.  If you take your eye off the ball, it’s over. If you take your eyes off Jesus, you will always fail.  Victory comes by looking to Jesus

This makes a radical difference. Jesus said his disciples “In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world." (Jn 16:33). The KJV says ‘be of good cheer; I have overcome the world’. So how are you today? Jesus says be of good cheer! There is a huge difference going into a battle knowing whether you will win or lose. David met Goliath in good cheer while the other Israelites hang back in fear and timidity. As believers we follow Jesus who has already overcome. Rather than face life with timidity and fear we can have confidence and be of good cheer in Christ. May God grant us faith to be strong in him. 

Verse 6 to 12 John talks about the various proofs that Jesus is the son of God and the inner testimony of God. There is a lot I could say but in short Jesus came by water, blood and spirit. There is a lot of debate about what these words mean and Martyn Lloyd-Jones describes these are some of the most complicated verses in the Bible. Most scholars point out the water refers to baptism and blood refers to Jesus death. In short they are a reference to the fact of Jesus life and then the inner testimony of the Spirit as we come to accept the facts of God’s testimony about Jesus. 

The final paragraphs from verses 13-21 are about the confidence and certainty we have in Jesus. Look at verse 13: “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life”. John writes so that people will believe. More than this he says we can know that we have eternal life. I once knew a believer who was never really sure if he was saved or not. He had grown up with a sort of faith and like most of us has had made many mistakes. Yet uncertainty in his faith kept him timid and beaten. But John says we can know. In fact throughout this whole letter John has repeated the word ‘know’ - it appears 33 times in the epistle. In these last verses he ends by reminding believers of what they should know. Verse 15 - we know that God hears us. Verse 15b - we know that we have whatever we ask if it is in accordance with God’s will. Verse 18 - we know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin. Although he may sin at times because of weakness, because of the work of the holy spirit he does not continue to sin. Verse 19 - we know that we are children of God and finally verse 20 – we know him who is true. John then ends ‘Dear Children, keep yourselves from idols’ (21). At first it seems a little odd and as if John suddenly introduces a whole new topic. John has never mentioned idols or idolatry in his letter until now. But this statement is closely linked to all he has been saying.  We have talked a lot about the Gnostics over the study of 1 John but the real issue is one of idolatry. False teaching can only take hold when we do not know the truth. When we do not know the truth we are susceptible to idols because we inevitably look for things other than Jesus to bring and give us life. When we have certainty in our eternal life in Jesus we are not led astray by heresies and false teaching.

As we end we can think ‘well I would not follow Gnostic teaching’ or ‘I know Jesus’. But John tells us “keep” yourselves from idols. The word ‘keep’ is drawn from the word “to guard”. It implies that we have something valuable that the enemy is trying to steal. Spurgeon points out that if a man has a box and he’s not sure what’s in it, he won’t be very careful about guarding it. But if he knows that it contains a rare and valuable treasure, he will be diligent to guard it carefully. John is saying that if you know the true God and His Son Jesus Christ, you have an incredible great treasure. Guard it so that you don’t drift into one of the many forms of idolatry. I read recently of how in the 1980’s treasure hunters looking to make a huge profit were stealing rare idols from the Hopi reservation in Arizona. The worst theft happened in 1978, when looters took four ancient stick figures representing the most sacred deities of the Hopi religion. The article said “Without the idols, there could be no Hopi rituals, and without the rituals, the tribe’s spiritual life was in danger of extinction.” A tribal leader explained that these ceremonies “bring blessings in rainfall, bountiful crops, good health, long life. That is being lost to us.”  What a sad description of idolatry! You make up your own gods and then use them to get what you want. The problem is, these gods may be stolen and your way of life is destroyed. If it can be taken from you, it isn’t the true God! But don’t make the mistake of thinking this is just others. As believers we are at risk. If you claim to follow Jesus you need to make sure you don’t fall into the idolatry of using Jesus to get what you want, or accepting the parts of Him that you like and reject the parts you don’t like. That is no different than pagan idolatry. “Dear children” implies that we are all vulnerable and weak.

In conclusion we have a great treasure in Jesus. We can have assurance and confidence in him. When we have a clear assurance about Jesus we are stable and confident. When we have confidence in Jesus we can live with courage, be of good cheer and overcome the world.
