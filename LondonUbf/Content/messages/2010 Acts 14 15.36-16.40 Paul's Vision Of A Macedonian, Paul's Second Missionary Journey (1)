PAUL'S VISION OF A MACEDONIAN, Paul's second missionary journey (1)

Acts 15:36-16:40 
Key verse: 16:9 
During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."

Today's passage records the beginning of Paul's second missionary journey. It shows how the work of pioneering European began, a key event in world history. We can learn how the Holy Spirit worked through it and how Paul served this ministry. 

Look at verse 15:36. 'Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing."' It was some time after Paul and Barnabas had attended the Jerusalem council. Paul suggested to Barnabas that they revisit the brothers in the churches they had established during their first missionary journey. The first missionary journey began through the command of the Holy Spirit and with much prayer and fasting by the believers. But the second missionary journey was not the result of a great plan instead it began from Paul's shepherd heart for the brothers of the pioneered churches. But the Holy Spirit had a great plan for this. Paul and Barnabas separated on account of John Mark. Barnabas and Mark went to Barnabas' hometown in Cyprus and Paul and Silas followed the route of the first missionary journey. 

Look at verse 16:1 ' He came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was a Jewess and a believer, but whose father was a Greek.' Paul and his companions arrived at Lystra via Derbe. Paul had risk his life, almost being stoned to death, to establish the church in Lystra. But now there was a disciple called Timothy, a man who, along with his mother, had accepted the gospel through Paul's ministry. His mother was a Jew and his father was a Greek. He was well-spoken of by the disciples in Lystra and Iconium. In 2 Timothy 1:4,5, Timothy is described as a man of tears. This shows he was a pure-hearted man with an earnest shepherd heart. He was a faithful man with sincere faith. Such a person comforts and encourages others. There was no visible fruit in Lystra during the first missionary journey. A lame man began to walk, Paul and Barnabas were treated as gods and soon after that Paul was stoned almost to death. But when Paul returned he saw that an influential disciple had been raised as a result of his first visit. 

Look at verse 3; 'Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.' Paul wanted to take Timothy in his journey as his co-worker. Because Timothy was an uncircumcised gentile had him circumcised to make him his co-worker. This seems contradictory to Paul's view in chapter 15:2 and in Galatians 2:3 Paul stood very firmly against having Titus circumcised. On this occasion too, Paul could have stuck to his way and fought against the Jewish legalists and keeping Timothy uncircumcised. But he allowed Timothy to be circumcised because he wanted to preach the gospel to the Jews. Jews emphasised circumcision. If Timothy was not circumcised, they would have been uncomfortable with Timothy and rejected the gospel he preached. Paul's priority was to preach the gospel and therefore he was flexible about circumcision if it enabled him to preach more effectively. 1 Corinthians 9:20 says that Paul became a Jew to the Jews and as one under law to those who were under law. But Paul was not under law, he was bound only to the gospel and free from everything else. He could bend his pride, his self-consciousness, his sense of privilege or anything else. Paul was truly free in the gospel. Look at verses 4 and 5.; 'As they travelled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey. 5So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.' 
Paul and his companions went around the cities that were pioneered during his first missionary journey and delivered the decisions of the Jerusalem council. So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers. Paul was not satisfied with just preaching the gospel but became a good shepherd by visiting new believers to strengthen their faith. 

It seems that Paul's pioneering ministry in Asia was going well. He must have been much encouraged and wanted to go on to new mission fields. But the Holy Spirit kept them from preaching in Asia. Paul went to the regions of Phrygia and Galatia as far as the border of Mysia. He tried hard to preach in Asia and then Bithynia on the coast of the Black Sea. The people in Asia were trapped by poverty, disease and ignorance. They sought security in magic and idol worship and were dying in them. Paul had a heart for them and when he preached the gospel they were saved and began to live new lives full of joy and hope. Paul had not been able to reach the northern Asia but he was eager to preach the gospel there in his second journey. However the Spirit of Jesus didn't allow them. We don't know how the Holy Spirit blocked Paul's journey. It could have been heavy snow, strike, lost visas, ash cloud or Paul's ill health. What is clear though is that when the Holy Spirit blocked them they could not go a step further. Nothing seemed to be going well in spite of Paul's exceptional zeal. This reminds us that the main driver of world mission work is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit opens and closes doors. He can lead us in the very opposite direction to the one we want to go in. But for the Holy Spirit to show us which doors we should go through, we need to try to open them first. 

Look at verse 8; ' 8So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.' Paul went west to Troas. Troas was the west end of Asia, one of the Mediterranean cities. Paul would have felt discouraged yet he sought God's will. He seems to have prayed till late at night and fallen asleep. During the night God showed him a vision. Look at verse 9. Paul saw a Macedonian man who was pleading with Paul to go to Macedonia and save them. Through this vision God guided Paul to preach in Europe rather than Asia. God wanted to save the Europeans. Humanly the Macedonians didn't seem to lack anything compared to the Asians. They enjoyed a rich Hellenistic culture and a wealthy, luxurious life. They were cultured, intelligent and advanced people. Compared to the Asians they must have looked very happy. But their spiritual state was not so good. Because of their anxiety people depended on fortune-telling (Ac 16:16). They looked fine on the outside but on the inside they were possessed by all kinds of sins. The people of Macedonia needed the light of the gospel. They were begging the gospel workers to come and preach the gospel to them. 

University students look fine, apparently they lack nothing. They look like the victors of a tough competition to enter university and seem to live a satisfying life. Yet on the inside, they are groaning because of all kinds of sin and need salvation. They are looking for Bible teachers. Like Rome in our time, Europe and North America are the most advanced countries to which students from all over the world swarm. They look like the Garden of Eden because of their material wealth. But on the inside they are corrupt like Sodom and Gomorrah. They need Bible teachers who can show them the clear purpose and direction for their lives and deliver the gospel of salvation. Not only in these advanced countries, but across the world, the West, the East, Asia and Africa, people are spiritually hungry and thirsty. They are asking for our help. 'Come to America and help us. Come to Europe and help us. Come to Brazil and help us. Come to China and help us.' The whole world is calling for prepared bible teachers. 'Come and help us.'

Look at verse 10. 'After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.' Paul at once cancelled all his plans and got ready to leave for Macedonia. It was not easy. He could have insisted that he really wanted to pioneer Asia. But he obeyed at once. He could do so because he was ready to obey God's will at any time, being free from his own ambition or ideas. When we live according to our ambition and ideas, we cannot immediately obey the will of the Holy Spirit. We must become pure and spiritual people in order to be able to obey the Holy Spirit's leading immediately. 

Why did the Holy Spirit lead Paul to Macedonia? The Holy Spirit had a greater vision than Paul's. Paul wanted to preach in Asia out of his shepherd heart. But if Paul stayed in Asia the gospel ministry might have been blocked by the Black Sea rather than gone out to the whole world. So the Holy Spirit led Paul to Macedonia and laid a foundation which led to the pioneering of Rome so that the gospel might be preached to the ends of the earth. The Holy Spirit led Paul in obedience to his worldwide perspective and his perfect redemption plan. No matter how excellent a man's plan is, it cannot equal God's. God's will has a clear understanding of history, it is higher, deeper and greater than that of any man. UBF sought to pioneer South East Asia in the 1960s. The vision was not for the world, just for South East Asia. People prayed for it and then a missionary was sent to Jeju Island as the first step in pioneering South East Asia. But after that the door was closed for 8 years before another missionary was sent to Singapore. People rejoiced that God had heard their prayer and opened a door to South East Asia. But the missionary to Singapore left the ministry and God opened doors to West Germany and the United States, wealthy, developed countries. Now God is working powerfully to pioneer Russia and developing countries. I pray that we may follow the Holy Spirit's leading with pure shepherd hearts like Paul and serve the pioneering mission to the full. 

Look at verse 11; 'From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day on to Neapolis.' Paul went straight to Samothrace after he had seen the vision in Troas. The next day he went to Neapolis and then arrived at Philippi, the first city in Europe. Paul went there with a great vision but the reality was quite different. He couldn't see anyone welcoming them. He could have doubted the vision. He came by faith but didn't know what to do, where to start. What did Paul do in this situation?

Look at verse 13; 'On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.' Paul stayed there for a few days and went out to look for a place to pray. When they went out, they found a group of women gathered by the river. We don't know what they were doing there. Maybe they happened to be washing their clothes together by the river. Paul preached the gospel to them. Then a woman called Lydia who was a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira opened her heart and accepted the gospel. God opened her heart. We can learn from Paul how to serve God's pioneering work. 

First, Paul pioneered by prayer. When he arrived at Philippi it was not an environment in which he could preach. They didn't have a synagogue. It was like a spiritual desert. But Paul didn't sit back because the situation was tough. He didn't have a bible centre with a table to do 1 to 1 Bible study, he did not even have someone to study the bible with. Instead he overcame by prayer and challenged the situation. 

Second, he pioneered through Bible study by the river. We can be excited after seeing a great vision but fail to serve the work practically. We can overlook 1 to 1 Bible study thinking that there should be a greater work to do. But a vision can become a fantasy if we do not work practically. Paul saw a great vision to pioneer European countries but what he did practically was to go to the river and preach to some women. We have a great vision of pioneering all the campuses in the world. What we should do practically based on this vision is serve 1 to 1 bible study. When Paul prayed and preached, God was pleased with him and sent Lydia to be his co-worker. Lydia and her household were baptised at once and she opened her house as house church. The church of God was established in Philippi. 

Look at verse 16; 'Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.' Once when Paul and his company were going to the place of prayer, they were met a slave girl who predicted the future by the demon which possessed her. Her owners earned a great deal of money by her fortune-telling. She followed Paul and shouted, 'These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.' She kept this up for several days and Paul became troubled. So he rebuked the spirit and drove it out of her in the name of Jesus. The girl couldn't carry on fortune-telling any more. Then the owners realised that their source of income was gone and seized Paul and Silas to accuse them. The magistrates didn't even hold a hearing before having them stripped and severely flogged. Then they were put in prison. They must have felt downhearted to once again face extreme persecution from the beginning of a new ministry. They could have felt homesick and worried about the challenge of pioneering. 

But what did Paul and Silas do at this time? Look at verse 25. 'About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.' They overcame the challenge by prayer and even praised God. How could they do so? It was because they had a clear attitude towards suffering. Paul had strengthened the believers, telling them that they should go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God. He came to meet Jesus more deeply and realise the grace of Jesus' cross through hardship. When he realised the grace of Jesus, he was overflowed with thankfulness and praise. How did God help them? Look at verse 26; 'Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody's chains came loose.' God caused an earthquake and opened the prison doors. Their chains came loose. The jailer thought all the prisoners had fled and tried to kill himself but Paul used this opportunity to preach the gospel to him. 'Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved'you and your household. (31)' The jailer accepted this message and he and all his household believed in Jesus. Paul met unreasonable hardship but through this gained a jailer as his co-worker. Another house church was established in Philippi. The next day Paul was cleared and freed. He used his Roman citizenship to leave the city as a victor. The great work of pioneering Europe began in a very unexpected way, gaining Lydia a dealer of purple cloth and a jailer as co-workers.  

In conclusion, we learn that the work of pioneering Europe began by the leading of the Holy Spirit. We easily lose heart and fall into despair when things don't go according to our plan and will. But such times can be the best opportunities to see the vision of the Holy Spirit. These are times to be led by the Holy Spirit. They are times to look for God's greater will and serve it. The Holy Spirit led and used Paul in his perfect will for world mission work. Through this world history was changed. The Holy Spirit has a great will for each one of us and works powerfully in us. May we obey his will rather than our plan so that we may be used by him preciously in his world redemption work.
