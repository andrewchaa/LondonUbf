Paul In His Rented House

Acts 27:1-28:31
Key verse: Acts 28:30,31
For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him. Boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ.

Today's passage talks about Paul's journey from Caesarea to Rome. God fulfilled his will to send Paul to testify to the gospel in Rome. May God help us to learn Paul's spirit and faith to teach the word of God in his rented house.

Look at verse 1. "When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment." Paul finally got on board the ship that was to be sent to Rome. Luke, the author of Acts and Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica (27:2, Col 4:10) accompanied him on this journey. They must have got permission as Paul's personal doctor or a secretary. There were other prisoners on the ship who were sentenced to death. All of them were escorted by Imperial regiment and were under the leadership of the centurion Julius.
 
The name of the ship was the Adramyttium and it was a regional trade ship. It was too small to cross the Mediterranean. The ship left Caesarea and passed Sidon and Cyprus, arriving and landing at Myra in Lycia. Paul and his companions changed there to the bigger Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy. They made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. The wind did not allow them to hold their course and they sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. They moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea. Fair Havens means a beautiful port and still it has the same name. Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Fast, that is, the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) which was the 10th day of Tishiri. It is hard to sale in the Mediterranean after September-October. Paul knew this very well and warned people. ""Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also." "(10) People disagreed whether they had to sail or not. The pilot and of the owner of the ship thought that Fair Havens was too small to find suitable lodging for winter so, they wanted to go to the bigger port Phoenix ' 65 km west of Fair Havens.. This was a harbour in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest. More people, including the pilot and of the owner of the ship wanted to go to Phoenix. They felt it was worth the risk for the extra comfort. Hence, the centurion supported their decisions and decided to sail. (11).When they set out, the wind blew gently south. (13). They must have been happy with their decision to sail. However, what happened? Look at verse 14. "Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the "northeaster," swept down from the island." Soon they faced a squall. This turned out to be a hurricane called the Northeaster. It was very fierce. The ship had lost control and finally passed under a small island called Cauda (16-17) and they were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure. When the men had hoisted it aboard, they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along. They did everything they could to keep the ship from drifting away. All people in this ship took such a violent beating from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard. On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands. Nevertheless, they could not see the sun or any star for many days. The ship was completely lost under the ferocious squall. There was no hope.

The people had no room to eat because of this life threatening situation. Without hope of survival they couldn't eat (20-21). It was at this point when the people were suffering hunger and depression, that Paul said that they should have listened to him. This was not just to point out their mistakes. Instead, he wanted them from now on to listen to him as God's servant who depends on God. He told them to keep up with their courage. He said that only the ship will be destroyed but not one of them would be lost. This was because the previous night an angel of the God whom Paul served stood beside him and said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.' He encouraged the people to trust in his God.  

On the fourteenth night they were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, when at about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land. They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep. Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight. In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow. Yet, Paul discerned their will and said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved." So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away.  This now meant all would have to swim to get to the shore. 

Paul realised that people needed power to swim to the shore. So he encouraged them to eat well and then afterwards threw away everything that was left over. This was to lighten the ship so that there was more chance to reach the shore without being wrecked. When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could. Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.. They now had to escape. Soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners but the centurion stopped them doing so to spare Paul's life. The centurion ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. The rest were to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land in safety. All 276 people all safely arrived to the shore. 

Look at 28:1. Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta. The islanders showed them unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed them all because it was raining and cold. Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand. When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, "This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live." But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects. The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.

There was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed Paul and his companions to his home and for three days entertained them hospitably. His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after praying, placed his hands on him and healed him. When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured. They honoured them in many ways and when they were ready to sail, they furnished them with the supplies they needed.  After three months they put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island. It was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux. They put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days. From there they set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and on the following day they reached Puteoli. There they found some brothers who invited them to spend a week with them. And so they came to Rome ' about 75 miles away from there. The brothers in Rome had heard that they were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet Paul and his companions. At the sight of these men Paul thanked God and was encouraged. Paul must have been so moved when he entered Rome, where God gave him mission to preach. Also, he was encouraged by the believing brothers there. In Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him. Perhaps this was due to a positive report from Festus and the centurion Julius. 
Look at verse 17. Three days later he called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had assembled, Paul said to them: "My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans. The first thing Paul did in Rome was to invite Jewish leaders in Rome. He then explained himself that he hadn't done anything wrong against Israel or the customs of their ancestors. The Romans wanted to release him because he was not guilty of any crime deserving death. But, because the Jews objected, he was compelled to appeal to Caesar. This was why he was in Rome, not to bring any charge against his own people. He also said, 'it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain."
This hope of Israel is exactly what he testified before the Sanhedrin (23:6), Felix (24:15), Festus and King Agrippa (26:6). It is the hope of the resurrection of the dead that is fulfilled through Jesus Christ ' his own resurrection. This was hard for Jews who were waiting for a political messiah to accept. They rejected his message and this was why he was in chains.     The Jewish leaders in Rome replied that they had not received any letters from Judea concerning Paul and none of the brothers who had come from there had reported or said anything bad about him. They only wanted to hear what his views were, for they knew that people everywhere were talking against the sect.

The Jews in Rome        visited Paul's rented house. He taught the gospel from morning to evening. The essence of his teaching was about the kingdom of God and Jesus. The gospel is revealed through Jesus Christ, confirmed through his death and resurrection and fulfilled through his second coming. 

The essence of the gospel is that Jesus died for our sins and has risen again. It is first revealed through Jesus coming into the world, confirmed by his death and resurrection and is to be fulfilled by his second coming. The kingdom of God is different from what the Jews believed ' a politically ideal new kingdom ' instead it is a spiritual kingdom where God reigns. People arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. From morning till evening he explained and declared to them the kingdom of God and tried to convince them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets. Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe. They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: "The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your forefathers when he said through Isaiah the prophet. (25). Paul remembered at this 'Go to this people and say,  "You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving." For this people's heart has become calloused;   they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts   and turn, and I would heal them.' Through this, Paul deeply realised that God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles who would listen and then later to the Jews again. (Rom11;1-12, 25)

What did Paul then do? Look at 30 and 31. 'For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him. Boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ.'

First, Paul accepted all who came to him and testified to the Gospel. He did not stay in a prison but in a rented house. We guess that the rent was paid by the Philippi church or some of his supporters. He was not allowed to leave the house. He stayed there and served all who came. Various people came ' some from the house of Caesar (Phil 4:22), escaped slaves, etc. To all these people in season and out of season Paul preached the kingdom of God and everything about Jesus Christ. This was the climax of his mission life and also that of the book of Acts. Though he was not allowed to go out, in his rented house, without anybody's interruption, he could boldly preach the gospel. 

Second, it was for 2 whole years. For two years there was not any trial because his Jewish accusers did not arrive. In those days a case needed to be re-opened within 18 months. We presume that Paul must have been freed after 2 years because of this. We can see God's divine intervention in leading Paul to this rented house for 2 years to preach the gospel whole-heartedly. This ministry also reminds us of his ministry in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. In fact, Paul's vision for Rome came from the successful ministry in Tyrannus. The ministry in Rome looked seemingly quiet yet, the gospel was spread across the Rome during this period. Later he testifies in 2 Tim 2:9. 'for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained.' Also, during this period, he has written four books - the Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon and Philippians.
Third, the Author Luke finishes the book of Acts in incompletion. It ends with 'Boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ.' The gospel was rejected in Jerusalem but in Rome ' in the centre of the world ' the gospel was preached without any hindrance. It seems very trivial, Paul, just one person entering of Rome and the 1:1 ministry in a rented house. Yet, this changed the stream of world history. This conquered Rome ' the centre of the world. This gospel, preached across Rome, became also the foundation of the western civilization. All of these started from the work of the word of God in a rented house of a prisoner.
From this passage I am struck by mustard seed of the word of God and Paul's faith and perseverance. From the world's point of view Paul seems so insignificant. He is a prisoner on a ship bound for Rome. Even the Jews in Israel, who regarded him as such a threat in Jerusalem, seemed no longer interested in pursuing him to Rome. In Rome he is one old man under house arrest, a seemingly powerless figure. And yet he never tired of welcoming all who came to him and boldly preaching the kingdom of God and taught about Jesus Christ. The effect was probably slow at first but one phrase is striking: 'without hindrance.' Much could have hindered and blocked Paul's effort. Yet God's word continued to work and to grow because God himself was working. This reminds me of Gamaliel's words to the Sanhedrin in Ch 5:39, 'But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.' Boldly and without hindrance the word of God continued to expand, person by person, and not even the severest Roman persecution could prevent it spreading and changing the world. The book of Acts continues to this day.
On Friday Jonathan was commenting on how quickly our generation is losing its Christian legacy, and our society is fast descending back into spiritual darkness and ignorance. Such thoughts can make one despair and fear for the future. In this regard Paul's example is so encouraging. There was none such a dark and godless and pagan environment as 1st century Rome and yet the simplicity of teaching God's word had a great impact. The enormity of our task, and the slowness of the work to raise just one disciple can make us ask why bother? What difference can this make, does it matter whether I go to out reach today or not? Yet the difference long term is immense. I am sure this is the most valuable work and will have a huge impact long term. Simply like Paul I need to keep inviting and welcoming students to study the Bible and teach about the kingdom of God and the Lord Jesus Christ.      
In conclusion, Paul was bound as a prisoner. But God's word is not chained. It spread out. The book of Acts is continuing today. It is the work of the Holy Spirit. He works actively and powerfully even now through his servants. This will continue to the day of Jesus' second coming. Thank and praise God who gave each of us his spirit and bless us to continue his work. May God help us to trust in the power of gospel like Paul and serve those whom he sent whole-heartedly with 1:1 bible studies. Amen.
