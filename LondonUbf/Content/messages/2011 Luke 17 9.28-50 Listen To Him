2011 Luke 17

LISTEN TO HIM

Luke 9:28-50
Key Verse 9:35
A voice came from the cloud, saying, �This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.�
 
Today�s event happened eight days after Peter�s confession. Straight after Peter�s confession, Jesus had started to teach the way of Christ to them. This must have shocked the disciples. To help them Jesus took Peter, John and James to the mountain. There, he showed his glorious transfiguration. Then, God said to them � listen to him.� May God help us to see the transfigured image of Jesus and also listen to him.
 
Look at verse 28. �About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.�  This was eight days after Peter�s confession. The disciples were probably still recovering from Jesus telling them about what would happen to him and also what was involved in following him. They could not imagine the Christ of God would have to suffer and die and it made them worry about their own future too. It was not an easy time for Jesus either. You can imagine how Jesus felt carrying the burden of knowing exactly what he must do and what would happen to him. The disciples were not capable of supporting him because they did not want to even think about the possibility or even listen to such disturbing news. Instead, they were under a cloud of doubt and regret. What did Jesus do at that time? He took Peter, John and James onto the mountain to pray. We don�t know what mountain this is, but to go up a mountain means to withdraw, to be away from people and alone with God. Remember Luke always mentions Jesus praying at key and important times in his mission. Here he wanted to prepare for his future through prayer; to pray for God�s will and the necessary strength to take his cross to the end. He also wanted to help his disciples through prayer, to encourage them and lift their vision beyond the gloom of suffering to his future glory. All the time we see Jesus praying, how much should we pray, when we face problems that we can�t handle, we need to pray. 
What happened when Jesus prayed? Look at verse 29. �As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.� In the Old Testament, Isaiah had prophesied Jesus� appearance in chapter 53:2-3 �He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.� As Isaiah had prophesied, Jesus had no visible majesty, a root out of dry ground. This is an image of Immanuel God, God with us, who although was in very nature God humbled himself, becoming a servant. This was an image the disciples were used to. Yet, how did his appearance change? We see Luke struggle for words to describe him, his face changed, his clothes as bright as a flash of lightning. This is Jesus� original image, the one he had given up to be with us the one which he enjoyed with his father since before creation. Next week we are going to have our conference, studying Revelations where we can think more about Jesus� glorious image. Apostle John describes the glorious appearance of Jesus, in the first chapter of Revelations like this. �And among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance� (Rev 1:13-16).How pure, holy and glorious, is Jesus! This is Jesus� original appearance in heaven and also how he will be when he comes again. Jesus came into this world like a root out of a dry ground to serve sinners, yet he is the king of kings who will rule his people with love at the right hand of God Almighty. 
Why did Jesus then show his glorious image to his disciples? It is because he wanted to show that his disciples� lives would not end in suffering but at the end there is incomparable, glory for them. Jesus wanted his disciples to continually and joyfully take up their crosses with faith and hope in this glory. Who did Jesus talk to when he was transfigured? Look at verses 30 and 31. �Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendour, talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfilment at Jerusalem.� Jesus began talking with Moses and Elijah about his death. Who are Moses and Elijah then? Moses suffered a lot while leading the Israelites out of Egypt. The Israelites grumbled and complained to God and Moses whenever they faced problems. They even wanted to stone him (Ex 17:4). At one point Moses cried out to God, �You have been telling me to lead these people,� but you have not let me know whom you will send with me.� At that time Moses asked to see God� glory and God said to him, �I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name the Lord, in your presence. I will have mercy on who I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. But he said, �you cannot see my face, for no-one can see my face and live.� Moses suffered so much and God encouraged him with a glimpse of his Glory. Elijah also suffered a lot to turn the Israelites hearts from idolatry. He fought 850 prophets of Baal, yet as a result Jezebel the queen wanted to kill him. He felt lonely and exhausted after this and even wanted to die under a tree. �While he himself went a day�s journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. �I have had enough, LORD,� he said. �Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.� 1 Kings 19:4). At that time God also encouraged Elijah with earthquake, wind and fire, and then through his still, small voice of calm. Elijah and Moses suffered more than most, and yet here they were, 1400 and 700 years later sharing in Jesus� glory. The message from Jesus to his disciples was this: suffering is for a short while but then share in my glory for eternity.
 
Yet what were Moses and Elijah speaking about? �They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfilment.� Remember this was not the disciples� favourite subject, they didn�t want to hear about Jesus� death. They didn�t want to hear about the cross. Yet, Moses and Elijah talked about his departure which he was about to bring to fulfilment at Jerusalem. Moses and Elijah represented the law and the prophets. All law and the prophets in the Old Testament point to Jesus. The Law points to the Holiness of God, prophecy points to God�s plan for world salvation. Jesus came to fulfil and accomplish everything the law and the prophets spoke about through his death on the cross and resurrection. Departure here is translated from the Greek ten exodon, referring to Jesus� departure as an exodus. Jesus death on the cross would be a second exodus, leading all mankind out of slavery and Satan�s grasp. 

How were the disciples when Jesus was talking with Moses and Elijah? Look at verses 32 and 33. �Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, �Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters�one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.� (He did not know what he was saying.)� Peter is loveable because he is so transparent. But he reveals something that potentially lies in all of us. A desire to camp out in experiences of God�s glory and live a sheltered life forever, rather than using them as moments of encouragement that then strengthen us to take the cross. Next weekend we are going to Asburnham, we pray to receive God�s word and spiritual refreshment, I hope it is a mountain top experience, but we should not then seek to stay there, but to return and take up our cross and continue in our spiritual battle. 

Look at verses 34-35. �While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. A voice came from the cloud, saying, �This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.� God covered them with a thick cloud and spoke himself. Clouds in the Old Testament tended to signal God�s presence and glory. When the people set up the tent of meeting a cloud covered it and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle (Ex 40:34). This was one of three occasions that God speaks directly in the gospels. On each occasion he testifies to Jesus. Here he wants the disciples to know who Jesus is and to listen to him. Peter just wasn�t listening to him, he wanted another way without suffering, he didn�t want to listen to Jesus� message of the cross. Here one sees God resorting to direct intervention so that Peter would listen. Our hearts can naturally be resistant to Jesus� hard teaching. Instinctively we want to put up shelters, retreat into our comfortable homes, or laptops, or whatever way, rather than serving students or each other. Yet it is only by listening to Jesus and following him to the cross that we ultimately can share in his glory.
II. Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy (37-40)
Look at verses 37-40. �The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. A man in the crowd called out, �Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him. I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.� How sad the father of this boy must have been. The boy was his only son. He must have really loved him. Yet, he became demon possessed. A spirit seized him and he suddenly began screaming; it threw him into convulsions so that he foamed at the mouth. It scarcely ever left him and was destroying him. The father suffered unthinkably. It can be the case that in the spiritual battle Satan often attacks our children. If we think about the daughter of Jairus, the widow of Nain, the Syro-phoenician woman, and now this father, in each case the parent is rendered helpless and desperate for their child. We love our children, and as parents of faith, our faith perhaps can be most easily knocked and we can be most easily distracted from God�s work by our fear and despair and helplessness over our children. There can be a temptation to try and serve our kids simply humanly, rather than spiritually battle for them in prayer, and helping them with the word of God. In that respect, this father had done the right thing. He had taken his son to disciples and begged them to heal him. However, disciples couldn�t heal the boy. The father now took the boy to Jesus. 
Jesus disciples when they first went out to preach healed many and preached powerfully. Compared to then, they now seemed to be more mature and better trained and experienced. However, why were they now helpless? Look at verse 41. �You unbelieving and perverse generation,� Jesus replied, �how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.� Jesus called them an unbelieving and perverse generation. The disciples had been with Jesus for the last 3 years. He had taught them the word of God and served them with prayer and love. He had endured their unbelief and weakness and helped them to grow as men of faith. However, even though his death was approaching, still they hadn�t changed much and were faithless and perverse. Jesus lamented. Why did then they become so powerless? It was because they had stopped relying on God by faith. At first, when they had had nothing, they really trusted in the authority which Jesus had given them. They didn�t trust in anything else but Almighty God. God blessed their faith and worked powerfully through them. �Have faith in God,� Jesus answered. �I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, �Go, throw yourself into the sea,� and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for them (Mk 11:23) However, now they had lost this pure and simple faith. They had wandered with unbelief and doubt. They didn�t trust in God nor pray. They lost their shepherd heart and relied on their own experience in helping this boy. When they stopped relying on God, they became powerless and were humiliated by the spirit.   
Jesus called them an unbelieving and perverse generation. The question then is how can we believe, how can we continue to grow in our faith in a way that pleases Jesus? First, listen to Jesus! Romans 10:17 says, �Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.� Faith comes from listening to Jesus. Listening means relying and trusting his words not our own strength or idea. For us to grow as men and women of faith, we need to keep hearing Jesus words. Second, obey Jesus. Because the disciples had stopped listening to and relying on Jesus it was difficult for them to follow and obey him. The power of faith and obedience is closely related. The disciples grew weak in their faith because they didn�t want to hear about the cross, they became weak, lost faith and power, and Jesus even uses the word perverse. They were even shamed by the demon. As disciples of Jesus we can keep growing in our faith if we keep listening and obeying Jesus and taking our cross, faith is not a matter of years we have been a Christian but the extent to which we listen to Jesus words and struggle to obey them.
How did Jesus heal the boy? Look at verses 42-43 �Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father. And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.� Satan tried to plant unbelief in the heart of father by throwing the boy to the ground in a convulsion even as he came to Jesus. Sometimes, we also experience this. When we bring people to Jesus sometimes it looks like their situation is getting even worse than before. Yet, we should not be deceived by Satan�s lie. We should firmly trust in God and bring them to Jesus. How did Jesus heal the boy? But Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father. The boy was completely healed. The evil spirit was expelled by Jesus� rebuke. The disciples did their best but could not do anything yet Jesus was able to expel the devil in one word. In Mark�s gospel, the disciples asked Jesus why this was the case. (Mark 9:28-29 After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, �Why couldn�t we drive it out?� He replied, �This kind can come out only by prayer.) Faith comes through believing the word of God and true faith is expressed through sincere, never-giving up prayer. 

�And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marvelling at all Jesus did, he said to his disciples, �Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.� (44) Jesus does not let up. May be the disciples wanted for just one moment to enjoy some of the success and share in the glory of God�s work with this boy. But Jesus again immediately started to tell them about his betrayal. He did not want the disciples to enjoy his popularity as he knew the people would later betray him. Jesus disciples needed to learn not to enjoy people�s good opinion or be too discouraged when people rejected and betrayed them. In verses 46 -48 the disciples argued about who would be the greatest. Jesus helped them to understand that the one who welcomes a little child, helpless and at times demanding and who can do nothing to repay them, is the greatest. Finally Jesus helps his disciples to broaden their view of God�s work, rather than being exclusive and glory seeking. Jesus can use anyone who faithfully serves in his name.

In conclusion, Jesus gave Peter, James and John sight of his bright and glorious image. He wanted to encourage them and strengthen them, by helping them see through the approaching suffering to the eternal splendour and victory of the risen Jesus. Yet it was also important that they listened to him, in particular that they listened to the message of the cross. By listening to Jesus and taking his cross can we grow in our faith and live victorious and powerful lives that please Jesus. As we prepare for next weekends conference, let�s pray to listen to Jesus.
