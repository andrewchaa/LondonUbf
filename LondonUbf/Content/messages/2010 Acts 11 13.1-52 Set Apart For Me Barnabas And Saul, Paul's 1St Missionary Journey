2010 ACTS 11

SET APART FOR ME BARNABAS AND SAUL, Paul's 1st missionary journey

Acts 13:1-52 
Key Verse: 13:2,3 
While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them." So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.
The book of Acts can be divided into two parts. In Ch 1-12, the main recipients of the Gospel were the Jews and the leader of the church was Peter. In 13-28, however, the main target of the ministry is the gentiles and the leader of the gentile ministry is Paul. Also, from chapter 13, the centre of the Christian church shifts from Jerusalem to Antioch. From this point on boundary of church moves beyond Jerusalem to the ends of the earth as Jesus commanded in Acts 1:8. Apostle Paul's first missionary journey was roughly around the late AD 40s. During that time, he went to Cyprus, Pisidian Antioch, Iconium and Lystra and then returned to Antioch. Today's passage talks about his mission journey in Cyprus and Pisidian Antioch. Through this we can see God's heart for world mission and his desire to save all men. We also learn the importance of well trained Bible teachers. 
Look at verse 1. 'In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul'. The church of Antioch mentioned briefly in Chapter 11:19-30 now comes back into focus. We can see from verse 1 the growth of the Antioch Church. There were many prophets and teachers. Prophets were those who were called by God, they had a special gift of prophesy (11:27). Teachers were those who had a talent to teach the Bible. Among them, there were Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen and Saul. Perhaps, this list is written based on the age or spiritual experience in the church of Antioch. Interestingly, Barnabas was written first and Saul was written at last. 
Simeon was called Niger. We can guess from his name that he is from Africa. Lucius was from Cyprus and it seems that he is Paul's relative (Ro16:21). Manaen was a member of royal family. He was brought up together with Herod. However, she or he did not rely on their royal status but on God. These three together with Barnabas and Saul became the leaders of the church of Antioch. Though it is not clear which roles they had taken, it seems clear that among them ' Barnabas and Saul were the most influential. We can also see that the church of Antioch consisted of people from many different social backgrounds. This made the church of Antioch very suitable to serve gentile mission. 
What happened to this church? What can we learn from the church of Antioch? Look at verses 2 and 3. 'While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them." So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.' 
First, the church of Antioch worshipped the Lord and fasted. What does it mean to worship the Lord and fast? Fasting means, to reject physical satisfaction in order to receive the Holy Spirit and his direction. They fasted to know and serve God's will. The church of Antioch relied on God for everything and from time to time fasted to know God's will more clearly. The head of our church is God. The church of God must sensitively discern his will and obey it. Therefore, when necessary, we need to fast to find his will.  
Second, the church of Antioch was obedient to the Spirit's leading. This was proved when they sent off Barnabas and Paul for world mission. "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them' God commanded them to set apart for him Barnabas and Saul for the work to which he has called them. He asked them to do this as of first priority. Humanly this is very hard to obey. The church of Antioch was only pioneered recently and was still growing. Barnabas and Paul's absence was unthinkable. Yet, God's command shows us how urgent his world mission command is. World mission is not only given to some churches like the church of Antioch or UBF. It is given to all churches. It shows God's burning desire to save all people. For this purpose, God forgave and called Saul and established the church of Antioch. For this purpose, he had taught them the Bible intensively for the last year and revealed his will. Saving the souls of those who have been captured by Satan is not easy. Therefore, God wanted to send his most experienced servants who could fight a good fight in gentile territory. 
The Antioch church immediately obeyed the direction of the Holy Spirit. It must have been so hard to send off Barnabas and Saul ' the pillars of their church. Yet, they fasted, prayed and obeyed the direction of the Holy Spirit. They placed their hands on them and sent them off
Here we can also think of why God changed his focus from the Jerusalem church to the church of Antioch. It is because the Jerusalem church did not fully overcome their Judaism. Also, they did not fully understand Jesus' world mission command (Acts 1:8). They still valued the Law and didn't simply accept the power of the gospel. On the other hand, the church of Antioch, a gentile church, was free from such influence. They simply accepted the power of gospel and had no prejudices. They were open-minded and were international. They were much better suited for world mission. God therefore used the church of Antioch in sending the 1st missionaries to the gentile world. God oversees each gospel ministry. He knows our good points and weaknesses and uses us in the right place.  
Look at verse 4. "The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus." At first they went to Seleucia, which is about 26 km west from Antioch. There they sailed to Cyprus. Cyprus was Barnabas' hometown (4:36) and some members of Antioch church were also from Cyprus (11:20). They arrived first at Salamis, sent by the Holy Spirit. Their ministry was not led by themselves but by the Holy Spirit. They went wherever the Spirit directed. When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. (5). They preached to all people, starting from their own people. John called Mark was with them as their helper.
They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. The distance between Salamis and Paphos was about 180 Km. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The name Bar-Jesus means the son of Jesus or the son of Joshua. He was a false prophet but seems to have greatly influenced the proconsul. The proconsul was very intellectual and wise person. He sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God. But Elymas the sorcerer, who, is in fact Bar-Jesus, opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.
How did Saul re-act at this? Look at verses 9-11.'Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said, "You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord? Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind, and for a time you will be unable to see the light of the sun." Here the author calls Saul 'Paul' for the first time. Saul means to be saved or to be called in Hebrews. Paul is a Roman name meaning to be small. It is a fairly unimpressive change yet by calling him Paul he would be able to serve gentile mission more effectively.
Here we learn that we need to be flexible and change our image in order to serve our mission field. In order to serve students we need to become like them. Find out what they are interested in, how do they communicate: Facebook, Twitter, My Space.  Also Students are young yet many of us are approaching middle age, we should not show our age by wearing fusty old fashioned clothes but dress as they do, keeping a young spirit. Paul changed his name because he put his mission to the gentiles first.
As soon as Paul told Elymas that he would not see the sun, mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand. Look at verse 12. "When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord." To the proconsul, Bar-Jesus was one of the most influential people. He was his spiritual mentor. Yet, he lost his sight at Paul's one word. This shocked the proconsul. But, most of all, he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord. His spiritual desire arose when he saw miracles, yet he had the right attitude to the word of God. He had desire to hear and accept God's word. 
Look at verse 13. "From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem." Here, Luke the author talks about 'Paul and his companions.' Revealing that Paul had become the leader of this group. He proved his spiritual authority by defeating the false prophet Elymas and bringing the proconsul to faith. Paul's group sailed to Perga in Pamphylia. Perga was the centre of Pamphylia, north from Cyprus. What happened there? John Mark left them and went back to Jerusalem. We don't know why he went back. Perhaps, he missed his home town. Perhaps, he was scared when Elymas became blind. We don't know. Because of this later Paul and Barnabas were separated. This shows how Paul was discouraged by John Mark at this time (15:37-39).
Look at verse 14-15. Paul and Barnabas went to Pisidian Antioch. Pisidian Antioch is situated 1100 meters above sea level. It was built by Seleucus. According his custom, Paul entered the synagogue and taught the words of God. When they entered the synagogue and sat down, the synagogue rulers sent word to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have a message of encouragement for the people, please speak." At this, Paul stood up and preached. Verses 16-43 is about the message that he preached in the synagogue. This was the first recorder message of Paul. The contents are similar to that of Peter (2:14-36, 3:11-26, 10:34-43) and Stephen (7:1-53). Though it he proved that Jesus is the messiah through quoting the Old Testament.
He preached not only to the Jews but also to Gentiles who worshipped God but were not yet converted(16). Paul told them how God chose Israel and led them out of Egypt. They were wicked and unfaithful, yet God was patient with them and bore with them for 40 years. As promised to Abraham, God destroyed the seven tribes in Canaan and gave them the land flowing with milk and honey. This took 450 years ' 400 years in Egypt, 40 years in the desert and 10 years of war in Canaan. After conquering Canaan, God gave them judges to rule over them. This lasted about 400 years until the last Judge Samuel. Then the Israelites asked for a king to be like other kingdoms. (1 Sam 8). Asking for a king was rebellion towards God. God was angry with them (Hosea 13:11), yet graciously he gave them a king. The first king was Saul a man from the tribe of Benjamin. He ruled over Israel for 40 years. Afterwards, God raised up David as a king, a man after his own heart. God's will would be fulfilled through the line of David. Then, what was his will? It was not to build a super power Israel. God wanted to send a messiah through the line of David. Therefore, Paul skipped all history after David and jumped strait to Jesus. Look at verse 23. 'From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised.'
The prophet Nathan revealed God's promise to send a messiah through David (2Sam 7). According to that promise, he sent Jesus into the world. John the Baptist first testified about Jesus. He clearly testified that Jesus, who came after him, is the Christ and the Saviour. Yet, what happened to him? Jesus, though he was innocent, was sent to Pontius Pilate and was sentenced to death. He died on the cross. Yet, he died not out of misfortune but his death absolutely fulfilled God's promise. (26). People buried him in a tomb, yet God raised him from the dead. (30). The risen Jesus showed himself to the disciples. In Paul's time, the eye witnesses of his resurrection were still alive.
His resurrection was prophesised many times in the Psalms. Paul preached about Jesus with all his heart. Christianity is not abstract philosophy. It is the revelation of God's will, it is a historical fact. 
What did this message mean to all those who were listening? Look at verses 38-39."Therefore, my brothers, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses." What they needed to do was to receive forgiveness from Jesus. Up to that point in history the Jews had wanted to gain righteousness through the Law. Yet, no person on earth had ever become righteous by keeping the Law. Paul concludes that we can be forgiven and become righteous only by believing in Jesus. This was the point of his message. Later this became the main theme of the Romans and is the foundation of Christian faith. In Romans Paul emphasised that the Law only makes us aware of sin but it is the faith in Jesus Christ alone which saves us from sin and makes us righteous. Paul also warned them that it is possible they may never believe, even though someone told them (40,41). 
Look at verses 42 and 43. 'As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath. When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God." After hearing Paul's preaching, people were encouraged. They asked him to speak at the next Sabbath. After the meeting, many followed Paul and Barnabas. On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. (44). 
However, When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and talked abusively against what Paul was saying. At this, Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: "We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles. For this is what the Lord has commanded us: " 'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'
Paul saw the rejection from Jews the fulfilment of the God's prophecy (Isa 49:6). Here, the light for the gentile is Jesus. It could also men Paul as he carried the gospel. From this point, Paul focuses on the gentile ministry (though he went to the synagogue first up until his disciple making ministry starts in the lecture hall of Tyrannus (Acts 19:18)). When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed. As the gospel ministry grew, the Jews became more and more jealous. They incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region. So they shook the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium ' which is about 70 km south east from Pisidian Antioch. And the disciples there were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. 
In conclusion, Apostle Paul's first missionary journey shows God's eager desire for world mission. Their mission journey had a huge impact on human history. Two missionaries sent out from the church of Antioch changed world history. The gentile world without the gospel is in darkness. They are spiritually ignorant. The people struggle to live well, yet fundamentally they suffer because they do not know the word of God and the meaning of life. They live under the power of sin without knowing salvation through Jesus Christ. God wants us to testify about the gospel to those people. For this purpose, he is waiting for the prepared gospel workers. May God help us to grow as well-prepared gospel workers and bible teachers ' men and women of God with clear gospel faith, who can teach the bible anywhere any time according to his will.
