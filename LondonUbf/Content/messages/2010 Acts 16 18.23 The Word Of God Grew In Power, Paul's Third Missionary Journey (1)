THE WORD OF GOD GREW IN POWER, Paul's third missionary journey (1)


Acts 18:23 ' 19:41
Key verse 19:20
'In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.'

In the last passage God told Paul not to be afraid but to keep on speaking. This passage introduces us to Paul's third missionary journey where we see the great impact of Paul's confident, powerful preaching and Paul gaining God's vision for him to preach in Rome. Unlike previous passages Paul does not travel a great deal but in spite of this the impact of his preaching was probably greater and influenced a wider area than it had previously. In fact Paul spent two years preaching in once place, the lecture hall of Tyrannus. What this passage teaches us is that Paul was most powerful and most greatly used when he was firmly rooted and growing in the word of God. I pray that through this passage we can learn from Paul that the secret to powerful, influential preaching and teaching is continually renewing ourselves with the word of God. 

Look at verse 23. "After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and travelled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples." Paul stayed in Syrian Antioch ' the headquarters of mission and then went on his third missionary journey. Luke doesn't mention who Paul took with him this time. Perhaps, he went on his own. He passed through Galatia and Phrygia, the route which he took in his second journey and then, carried on to his home town Tarsus then Derbe, Lystra, Iconium and Pisidian Antioch. Wherever he went, he strengthened the disciples. At this point, Luke introduces a man called Apollos. Look at verse 24. "Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures." In Paul's time, Alexandria was a centre of Hellenism and was often referred to as the Athens of North Africa. It was the centre of trade and philosophy. This is also the place where the Old Testament was first translated into Greek around BC280. Apollos was a Jew and being brought up in Alexandria, he was a learned man with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. Earlier on he had been instructed in the way of the Lord and spoke with great fervour. He also taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. The fact that he knew only about the baptism of John meant that he knew Jesus only through John's preaching and therefore he didn't know the essence of the gospel. So, basically the message he knew was; repent, the messiah is coming, he will baptise you with fire. Apollos knew that Jesus is the Lamb of God who has taken away the sin of the world.  Priscilla and Aquila could see Apollos's problem when they heard him preach. Without the joy of Christ he looked serious. So they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately. That is, they taught him Jesus' death and resurrection as well as the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. Through this, Apollos could experience the essence of the gospel. After meeting Jesus personally, he went to go to Achaia (Corinth) and became a great help to those who by grace had believed (27). The grace of meeting Jesus made Apollos a more effective bible teacher. He vigorously refuted the Jews and proved that Jesus was the Christ. (28).
Look at chapter 19 verse 1. "While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples" Whilst Apollos went to Corinth, Paul arrived in Ephesus. When Paul saw the disciples in Ephesus, he could not see the joy in their faces (Gal 5:22). So, he asked ' 'Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?' At this, they said they hadn't even heard of the existence of the Holy Spirit. Again this was because they only knew John's baptism, the baptism of repentance. John's baptism helps us to realise our sin, yet it is only a preparation for receiving Jesus. Paul taught the disciples, about 12 people, about Jesus and baptised them in his name and the Holy Spirit came on them. 

Look at verse 8. "Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God". Ephesus was a port city on the west coast of Asia Minor and the centre of trade and traffic. Paul had briefly visited Ephesus during his second missionary journey. At that time he said that he would come back to them if it was God's will (Acts18:21). He returned according to his promise and then went to the synagogue to teach the gospel to the Jews as was his custom (R1:16). He did this for 3 months, perhaps the longest time he taught in a synagogue. What was Paul's core message? It was 'the kingdom of God' The kingdom of God is the Kingdom where God reigns. This kingdom began with the coming of Jesus. On earth, this kingdom can grow when people continually come to Jesus and become children of God, being sanctified to continually hold the image of God. This kingdom becomes complete through Jesus' second coming. Paul preached the Kingdom of God in the synagogue once a week, speaking and arguing persuasively. He did so boldly and with all his heart. When someone attempted to refute the gospel he retorted with all his power to prove them wrong. What was the result of this form of preaching? Look at verse 9a. "But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way." Some were convinced by Paul's argument yet others became hard hearted. Consequently preaching in the synagogue became ineffective. How did Paul change his direction? Look at verse 9b. "So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus". This was a completely new approach. Paul left those who persecuted the gospel and concentrated on disciples. We presume that the disciples included the twelve disciples Paul met when he arrived in Ephesus and also some who had received the gospel in the synagogue. He took these disciples with him and taught them every day at the lecture hall of Tyrannus. 

What were the characteristics of the ministry in Tyrannus? First, he set apart disciples and focused on teaching them, instead of trying to persuade those who didn't want to accept the gospel. Secondly, he did not argue and try to persuade disciples but had daily discussions with them. This was not instruction by Paul but discussions between Paul and the Ephesian disciples. He welcomed their questions and clearly explained the word to them. It was very personal bible study. Third, he did not use the synagogue but a lecture hall. A synagogue is a place with many formalities. It may not have been approachable for non-Jews and perhaps it was a difficult place for the gospel message to be passed on. Instead Paul used a lecture hall which did not suffer from these problems, and there he taught groups of people or individuals the word of God as it is. Fourth, he had daily discussions. This is different from weekly synagogue preaching. Paul did this for 2 years. Outwardly this does not seem much. It was a quiet, ineffective looking ministry. Yet, what was the result of these 2 years of teaching? Look at 10b. "This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord". All people in the province of Asia heard about the gospel. This means the whole of the western part of modern Turkey. All the Jews and Greeks in those areas heard the word of the Lord. Their stubborn hearts were challenged and many of them came to faith. Paul stayed only in the lecture hall of Tyrannus and taught the disciples, but the word of God spread beyond the lecture hall through the disciples and their disciples. Not only the Ephesian church but also the churches of Colossae and Hierapolis (Col 4:13) were established during this period. In addition, seven churches including the churches of Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatria, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea were established. In short, Paul's Tyrannus ministry was very fruitful.
 
Luke also talks about the impact of Paul's ministry on idol worship in Ephesus. Look at verse 11. "God did extraordinary miracles through Paul.' Paul received special power in Ephesus, where sorcery and superstition were prevalent. People were healed even by Paul's handkerchiefs or aprons. There were Jews who went around trying to copy Paul by attempting to drive out evil spirits in the name of the Lord Jesus. They would say, "In the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out." Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. (One day) the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?" Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding. When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with holy fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honour. Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. A number who had practised sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. One drachma was roughly equal to one person's daily wage. So this is the equivalent of 50,000 days or 190 years. If we assume that a person's daily wage is '50 then, it means 50 times 50000, '2,500,000. 

How does Luke comment on the ministry in Tyrannus? Look at verse 20. "In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power." What does it mean that the word of God grew in power?  This means that the word of God worked powerfully in people's hearts and awakened them from their spiritual ignorance, changing them from within. Up until now, sorcery had been the greatest influence in people's lives and thoughts. Yet, when the word of God was preached, it revealed that sorcery is just a deceitful lie. The word of God destroyed their spiritual ignorance and brought them to the repentance that leads to life. Paul simply helped them to believe in the gospel of Jesus. When they accepted this, they were born again and became new creations. 

The word of God is like a double-edged sword which has power to destroy all things that hinder the gospel. It is alive with the power to penetrate anybody's heart and soul (Heb 4:12). No one can pretend in God's sight. God knows all things. The ministry of Asia was not Paul's work. What he did was simply serve disciples with the word of God. As a result, the word of God prospered. The only thing Paul did was teach in the lecture hall of Tyrannus, he did nothing else. Yet, the word of God grew in power, in fact the word of God exploded across the region. What changed people was the word of God. It is the word of God which makes people give their lives to God. In the same way Jesus was in the city of Capernaum for a great deal of his three and a half year ministry. During that time, he called the twelve and taught them the word of God. What Jesus did also looks insignificant. Nevertheless, the disciples became servants of God who changed the direction of world history. The word of God grows in power when it is well taught even though it may look quiet. 

Paul's ministry in Tyrannus teaches us the importance of knowing our audience as well as the word of God. We live in an individualistic society. One to one and group bible study, which touches each person's heart, is very important. However, this sort of work looks outwardly slow and ineffective. We need to be patient, believing in the power of God's word. We live in a society where materialism, humanism and false ideas are prevalent. We often become helpless thinking that we can't help anyone. However, the solution is in God's word. The word of God has power to destroy all things which oppose it. May God help us to deeply study the word until it becomes very powerful in our lives. May the word of God grow in power as in Paul's time and may we too preach it boldly. May God destroy all idols and may his kingdom come in the hearts of university students.

After experiencing the power of the gospel, Paul received God's vision for his future. Look at verse 21. "After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. "After I have been there," he said, "I must visit Rome also."" Paul decided to go to Jerusalem to help the believers there who were suffering as a result of a great famine. He wanted to go to Rome too. In saying 'I must visit Rome also' Paul shows his strong desire to preach the word of God in Rome. Rome was the most influential power at that time. All roads led to Rome. People with Roman citizenship could go anywhere. Businessmen, politicians and athletes all wanted to go to Rome. Paul wanted to go to Rome too in order to fulfil God's desire for world mission. In Paul's time, pioneering Rome meant pioneering the whole world. Humanly it looked impossible for Paul to conquer the Roman Empire with the gospel. Yet, Paul believed in the power of God's word. He experienced this very deeply in Ephesus. Based on this experience, he wanted to raise disciples in Rome too, simply by trusting in the power of God's word. He believed that the word of God had the power to conquer Rome. According to his faith, in AD313, Rome was conquered by the gospel and Christianity became the state religion. One person's faith can change the history of the world. God has entrusted us with campuses in the UK. By faith, we can also conquer them through the word of God and prayer. May God give us faith and help us to serve students with this faith. 

Look at verse 23. 'About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way.' When the word of God grew in power, people no longer wanted to worship Artemis. Artemis ' the goddess of the earth ' was regarded as the number one goddess. Yet, people stopped worshipping her. As a result, a silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, lost his business. This shows how the gospel quietly yet powerfully challenges godless cultures and traditions. The Gospel ministry continued regardless of the continual opposition and persecution. 

I am very good at doing things. I manage to get to daily bread most days, I write my testimony every week and go to outreach regularly. Yet what I see in this key verse is first that the work of God is not about me. I am very struck that when Paul stayed in once place for a long time his ministry was at its most fruitful. So for me doing many things is not what will make me into an effective Bible teacher and disciple maker. Instead it is the word of God. When I have the word of God in my heart God can use me. Therefore the key issue is about the quality of what I do. A few weeks ago I was studying the Bible with a student and I found I had no notes for the study. So I found a message and read it and prepared new notes. When we had finished the study he said that it was the best Bible study we had ever done. The difference was that I did not rely on old notes but instead I came freshly to the word and the word was more powerful as a result. Realising that I need to spend more time preparing I got a book on Mark's gospel last weekend and took it home. I still have not opened it. This is partly because I am busy with work but Luke talks in this passage about Paul's apron. Paul's apron reminds us that Paul was also a lay shepherd who had to work. Paul continued to be fruitful because he gave priority to deep prayer and deep Bible study. I cannot therefore use time as an excuse for not letting the word grow in me. In whichever way I can I need to make the time for deep prayer and really struggle to understand and accept God's word. When Paul relied on God's word in this way he was used powerfully and God made him into a man who could be used to pioneer Rome and change the world. I can continue to make excuses but if glorifying God is really the purpose of my life I need to struggle to let the word grow in me so that God's word can move through me to change this nation. 

In conclusion, the word of God is living. It has the power to destroy all the idols in people's hearts and establish the Kingdom of God instead. Paul fully experienced this and therefore he was full of zeal and passion to pioneer Rome. Today we see many idols. Yet, if we have firm faith in the word of God, nothing really matters. May God help us to have absolute faith in the word of God, which has the power to destroy any of Satan's plans. By this faith, may God help us to win the battle in one to one ministry this year. Amen.
