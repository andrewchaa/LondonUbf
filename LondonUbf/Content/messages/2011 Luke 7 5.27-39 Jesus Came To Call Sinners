JESUS CAME TO CALL SINNERS

Luke 5:27-39
Key verse 5:32
�I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.�

Last week we saw Jesus heal a leper of his leprosy and a paralytic of both his paralysis and his sins. The crowds said, �we have seen remarkable things today.� But immediately after this Jesus did an even more remarkable thing and called Levi, who everyone hated, to be his disciple. The Pharisees hated this but Jesus says; �I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.� Today�s passage asks us, do we have the heart of Jesus, the spiritual doctor, who loves lost sinners or the heart of the Pharisees and teachers of the law who condemn people who are not like them. I pray that through today�s message we may once again find the joy and freedom of repentance and become a blessing to those who do not know Jesus.. 

Look at verse 27: �After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. Follow me, Jesus said to him,� Jesus sees Levi sitting at his tax booth. Tax collectors were deeply unpopular in Israel. They collaborated with the Romans to collect their taxes as well as tax for the local rulers like Herod and made their profits by adding a bit more for themselves. Everyone hated tax collectors and when the gospel writers talk about the tax collectors they always include them along with the prostitutes in the lists of public sinners. These were people at the very bottom of society. But it is hard for us to imagine what these men were really like. This week Fran received her first pay slip and was disappointed to find that she had to pay �50 in tax from what she had earned. We don�t like paying tax but when we think about what we get in return, hospitals, schools, roads and police, we can accept it. 

But tax collectors in Israel were not just irritating guys who took money for the goods you bought from the market, your land, your animals, your wheels or for simply travelling along the road. They were also men who enforced the tax rules mercilessly. If you did not pay they would intimidate you and who would send big men around to your house to break your legs. They were fraudsters, bullies and violent, dangerous men. Today people like these are called loan sharks. They lend money to people who are desperate for money; poor people, old people, disabled people. They charge huge rates of interest, sometimes over 100%, and then they force people to pay it back. These are people who threaten old ladies, beat people up, take their belongings and wreck their houses all for money. These are people who, if caught by the police can end up in prison for very long periods of time. Instead of thinking of the tax collectors as parking wardens we need to think of them like drug dealers, the worst kind of people who we would never want to meet. This is the kind of man Levi was. 

But verse 27 says that Jesus �saw Levi� and said to him; ��follow me.� Why would Jesus ask a man like this to follow him? Because when Jesus saw Levi he did not just see a social outcast and a hated tax collector. Jesus saw three other things about Levi. First he saw who Levi had been. Jesus knew that Levi was not born a tax collector. Levi was a child of God just like everyone else. At some point he must have been a hopeful, idealistic young man, looking forward to doing something great for his nation and raising a family. No one grows up thinking; �when I grow up I want to be become a thug, a bully and a hated collaborator. The same is true for all people who have fallen into very public sins like Levi. Imagine the alcoholics around Archway. Once they were little boys in shorts who dreamed of being airline pilots or doctors. Jesus saw in Levi who had been in the past. 

Second, Jesus saw who Levi could be. Levi was bitter, ruled by greed and friends only with social outcasts like the other tax collectors and prostitutes. But Jesus had vision for Levi that rather than being a lost sinner he could become a great man of God. This must have been almost impossible to see but Jesus knew what was in Levi�s heart, he saw Levi�s business acumen and his tenacity. Jesus saw a man who had the potential to become a disciple and do great things for God. When Jesus saw Levi he saw the future disciple and the writer of Matthew�s gospel.

Third Jesus saw that Levi was ready to follow Jesus. Levi knew that he had made some terrible mistakes in his life, he regretted that he had become a tax collector. To everyone else he looked like an unrepentant sinner. But Jesus could see into his heart and knew how much Levi hated what he had become and wanted to change. He saw a man who was ready to follow Jesus so he said to Levi; �follow me.�

Look at verse 28. ��and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.� He must have been shocked to be called but his reaction was to get up, leave everything and follow Jesus. Levi was leaving his career, his wealth and his lifestyle. Why? Because Levi knew he was miserable, lonely and trapped. I made a similar decision to come and live in common life. I had a job, a house, a car, friends, a whole life in St Albans. But I was miserable. So when I was called to leave it all and come to London I did not hesitate because I knew that following Jesus was a far greater, more meaningful life. Being called by Jesus filled me with joy and it was the same for Levi. So when Jesus offered him a new life he knew he had nothing to lose so he got up immediately, left everything and followed him.

Look at verse 29; �Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.� Jesus� call to Levi changed him immediately. We can see this in Levi�s first reaction which was to throw a party for all his friends. This was the joy Levi felt at being freed from his sin and welcomed into the Kingdom of God by Jesus. Before meeting Jesus Levi had been a selfish man, now he was full of grace spending money to be a blessing to his friends. We can imagine the scene. Lots of people were gathered in Levi�s house. Tax collectors, prostitutes, loan sharks, drug dealers, alcoholics, all eating Levi�s food and drinking his wine, telling jokes and laughing and everyone having the opportunity to meet Jesus. All this was the fruit of Levi accepting Jesus� call. 

Look at verse 30; �But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, �Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and 'sinners'?� Not everyone was celebrating. Outside the house the teachers of the law and the Pharisees were looking in. The teachers of the law were at the top of Jewish society. They knew the Bible and they had added lots of rules and laws to it in order to help people obey God�s law. The Pharisees were the people who had paid the teachers of the law and passed their exams in order to become their disciples. They were people who kept the teachers of the law�s rules. 
When the teachers of the law first saw Jesus they would have been impressed. He knew the Bible even better than they did and he could teach it better than anyone. They must have thought he could be one of them and get some really great disciples. But as they looked at who Jesus was spending time with they were not impressed. In the teachers of the law�s opinion disciples ought to be morally good people and a teacher of the law should never be seen with sinners. The group of people outside Levi�s house was respectable, self-righteous and proud. The people inside the house were public sinners. The teachers of the law wanted to know why Jesus was with the public sinners and not with them. 
Look at verses 31 and 32; �Jesus answered them, �It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.� Jesus described himself as a spiritual doctor. A doctor�s job is to make sick people well. Therefore only sick people go to doctors. But when we do go to the doctor he never rebukes us for being sick. You don�t hear doctors saying; �You are so irresponsible, how did you get the flu?� or �I can�t believe you have allowed yourself to get a broken leg.� Instead doctors have compassion. Consequently they treat whoever comes, even those who have caused their own sickness and they are joyful when they see someone get well as a result of their care. As a spiritual doctor Jesus� job is to look after spiritually sick people, sinners, and make them well. 

We are also spiritual doctors and we need to learn Jesus� heart for lost sinners. It is very easy to judge people for their sin but instead we need a shepherd heart like Jesus. Rather than being burdened by the sin of our Bible students, colleagues or families we need to have compassion and see them as sick. When we see people as sick we don�t judge but instead we have pity and compassion as Jesus did. If someone comes into the centre in the morning with a cold we do not blame them for having a cold we offer them some orange juice and lemsip or maybe some ginseng. 

When someone comes who is spiritually sick we need to offer them the cure, the word of God. This means teaching people the Bible and helping them to repent as Jesus did for Levi. This is hard work. It can mean years of Bible study, spending time with people, praying with them and for them and challenging their sin. This is the difficult part. Jesus said �I have come to call sinners to repentance.� Teaching the Bible is fun but people only really meet Jesus when they acknowledge their sin and ask him to forgive them. Therefore true love involves helping people to find their sin, repent and find new life in Jesus. It is also an ongoing work. After Jesus had called Levi he raised him as a disciple over three years, patiently teaching him, encouraging him and helping him to find and repent of his sin order to grow as a disciple. We need this patient love for those whom we serve in order that they may come to have a deep, personal, repentant relationship with Jesus. 

The teachers of the law thought that the righteous were those who obeyed their rules therefore they believed they did not need to repent. But the Bible tells us that; ��all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Ro 3:3).� Therefore everyone needs to repent. That included the teachers of the law, the Pharisees, the prostitutes and the tax collectors. Daily repentance is fundamental to our lives of faith. We can only enter the kingdom of God if we find ourselves as sinners.  Levi knew he was a sinner. He had no doubt that he was evil and Jesus was very glad to share the gospel with him and his friends and welcome the repentant into his kingdom. The Pharisees and the teachers of the law on the other hand were too proud to admit their sin and refused to come to Jesus. Later Jesus would tell them, ��the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. (Matt 21:31)

Young people in this generation look very healthy. They are well fed, they have a good education, they have nice clothes and friends. But underneath they are sick because of sin. As we go to UCL we are tempted by two ideas. The first is to think that some students are too healthy because they look too good like the Pharisees. The second is to think that they look too sick like Levi. But everyone is a sinner in need of Jesus� forgiveness therefore we should not be put off by appearances instead we should have the attitude of a spiritual doctor and serve people with the word of God. 

Look at verse 33; �They said to him, John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.� This tells us something of the way in which the Pharisees and the teachers of the law judged people. They thought religious people were good. So they liked John�s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees because they fasted and prayed a lot. The teachers of the law and the Pharisees fasted twice a week. The problem with this was that when they fasted they fasted before men, they put ash on their faces and wore mournful looks and torn clothes so that everyone knew how holy they were. 
Look at how different this is to Jesus� attitude in verse 34; �Jesus answered, Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast.� When a wedding came around all the laws restricting people from eating and drinking were cancelled so they could enjoy the wedding. People spend thousands of pounds on food and drink for wedding receptions. It would be totally miserable and a complete waste if everyone fasted. Jesus is the bridegroom and he wants us to celebrate because he has come to free us from sin and give us new life. The Pharisees and teachers of the law were like people at a wedding refusing to eat. Instead they were trying to impress God by their religious habits. That is why Jesus talks calls them old wineskins and old garments (v6-39). They thought their laws, the rituals and religious habits would save them. Jesus is the new wine because it is Jesus who really saves us when we come to him and repent.  
We all want to be joyful like Levi but the problem with being like Levi is that what we see here is the first day of a man�s new life in Jesus. The original Pharisees and teachers of the law were very well intentioned, they wanted to keep the Bible at the centre of the life of Israel but as time passed they became complacent, self-righteous and judgemental. We all know that when we become Christians our sin does not completely disappear and over time we become weighed down by our sinful desires. We also begin to develop rules which say that you can be saved if you believe in Jesus and do this thing or if you do not commit some really terrible sin. How can we prevent ourselves becoming like the bitter and self-righteous Pharisees? Jesus tells us that he has come to call sinners to repentance. We need to repent. 

Repentance is the root of joy. That is why Levi was happy, because he had just left behind his life of sin. Repentance can feel very negative but in reality what we are doing is cleaning out our hearts in order that we can be free from the burden of sin. When we repent we are freed from our sin. Then like Jesus we become spiritual doctors. We cease seeing people as unforgivable sinners and instead we see lost sheep, prodigal sons, children of God and potential disciples and disciple makers. Therefore we need to come each day to Jesus with our sin and repent so that we can be joyful and a great blessing to those to whom God sends us. 
In conclusion. Jesus came to call sinners to repentance. Levi and the tax collectors were very public sinners, the teachers of the law and the Pharisees were very private sinners but both were sinners. We are sinners who have been given the grace of God in our lives and called to be spiritual doctors to the young people of the UK. Let�s learn to maintain a doctor�s heart for these people through daily repentance. Then we can see everyone as sick in their sin and have the compassion to heal them by teaching them the word of God and bringing them to repentance.
