WHAT MUST I DO TO INHERIT ETERNAL LIFE

Luke 10:25-42
Key verse 1025
�Teacher,� he asked, �what must I do to inherit eternal life�

There is no more important issue than eternal life. Jesus once asked �What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul� (Mk 836). The answer is obviously �nothing�. If we get the answer to the question of eternal life wrong everything else means nothing. There is no more important issue. Today we come to the story of the Good Samaritan. It�s one of the most famous parables of the bible and most people � whether believers or not - know the story of the Good Samaritan. To be a Good Samaritan has come to mean being kind to strangers, embracing neighbours and generally doing good. This is not the point of the story. The story of the Good Samaritan is Jesus� response to a man asking �what must I do to inherit eternal life�

I. What must I do to inherit eternal life (25-29)

Look at verse 25 �On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. �Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life� Jesus is teaching and while doing so a lawyer stands and asks him a question. To stand up was not uncommon. It was a way in public teaching to ask a question or to debate with the teacher. This man stands up and asks an important question �what must I do to inherit eternal life� Why does he ask this question 

First this was simply a common question of the day. Many were asking this question at the time. Jesus himself had spoken frequently of eternal life and it�s mentioned about 50 times in the new testament. The rich young ruler asked Jesus, �Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life (Luke 1818). In Acts chapter 2 after Peter preached at Pentecost the people asked �what shall we do� In other words what shall we do to be saved from God�s wrath How can I be accepted by God In Acts 16 the Philippian jailer after the earthquake had freed the prisoners and he was about to kill himself, asked Paul �what must I do to be saved (Acts 1630) People were asking themselves �what do I need to do to be accepted by God How do I gain eternal life� This man stood up and asked Jesus because like many he knew it was an important issue. 

Second, notice that this was a personal question. Often experts in the law or Pharisees come to Jesus just to trip him up or ask false questions to try and trap him. But I don�t think there is anything here to suggest that the question is anything but genuine. The man asks personally, �what must I do� He speaks personally about himself not generally about �people�, �the nation�, or �us� but wants to find an answer for himself. He also knows that he is personally responsible and that he must do something. This is a humble admission. Despite being an expert in the law who knows a lot about the bible, and is a good Jew, there is something missing and he does not have assurance of eternal life. His conscience told him that despite all the things he knew it was not enough to have eternal life and peace with God.  This man not only knew the question was important he also had personal motivation to ask Jesus. What an incredible privilege to be able to debate this question with Jesus.

So how does Jesus answer this central question Look at verse 26. �What is written in the Law How do you read it� Jesus directed his attention to the Bible. �What is written in the Law� Jesus answered that there was an answer in the Hebrew bible for the question of �what must I do to inherit eternal life� Jesus is telling the lawyer that the answer is found in the bible. Today many are interested in spirituality but don�t like Christianity. They don�t like the idea of a book that provides answers. But Jesus points clearly to the bible - �What is written in the Law� 

Jesus also asked, �How do you read it� It is important to go to the Bible and read what is written in it. But more important is how we read it. �How do you read it� means �How do you understand it� When we read the bible, we read it with our own prejudice � all have this and we need to guard against it. What matters is if we read and understand the Bible according to the intention of the Holy Spirit the writer of the Bible. What matters is whether we read and accept it with an obedient heart. We can read the Bible for intellectual satisfaction rather than to obey it.  This means the results of �how we read the Bible� differ tremendously between people. How do you read it can also translated, How do you read it every day Or, how do you recite it� The Jews recited the shema twice every day and Jesus seems to be hinting at this. 

So how is this expert in the law reading it What did he answer Look at verse 27. �He answered ��Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind�; and, �Love your neighbour as yourself.�� Without any hesitation the expert in the law answered. He rattled off the shema from Deuteronomy 64-5. So this man knows what really matters; he understood the teaching of the bible and knew that love was the summation of the law. Having heard the man Jesus replied in verse 28, �You have answered correctly.�  The man knew the answer. There was no gap in his knowledge. This man has the right question and the right answer. It all looks really good.

But notice Jesus does not stop there. He says in verse 28 �Do this and you will live�. Notice also that later in verse 37 Jesus again repeats �Go and do likewise�. So there we are. The person who perfectly loves God and who perfectly loves others, qualifies for eternal life. It is the person who truly loves God with all his capacity � all his heart, all his soul, all his strength, all his mind � that man has eternal life. The word �all� is repeated 4 times so nobody misses the fact that God is calling for perfect love with nothing left out. This means perfect trust in God, perfect devotion, perfect fellowship, perfect humility, perfect obedience, perfect hatred of sin and whatever dishonours God, perfect rejection of evil, perfect love for others, perfect longings for God's presence, perfect desire for truth. Jesus says �Go and do likewise.� 

Can anyone do that  You say, Come on! Nobody's going to be able to do that! And that�s right - it�s impossible. That is the point that Jesus is making. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. The man knew what he should do but the problem was that he is not in fact doing it and cannot do it. Nobody can keep the law to this extent. As Romans 320 says �no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.�. 

In saying �Go and do likewise� Jesus faced the man with the law to confront him with his wretchedness and inability and sin. The problem for eternal life was not knowledge, it was not information, it was not bible study but sin. 

At this point the expert in the law should have asked Jesus �But how do I inherit eternal life if I have not done this� He might have said something like, �Err�Jesus�now of course I am not talking personally� but let�s just say a friend of mine�a friend �might not have done this�What should he do to inherit eternal life�� 

As believers we tend to jump and if people ask �what must I do to inherit eternal life� we say �believe in Jesus�. But before this is a vital step � we must be convicted of our sin. The expert in the law knew many things but he did not know the most important � that he was a sinner who needed to fall on his knees with a broken contrite heart and ask for God�s mercy. 

Yet what is his response Look at verse 29 �But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus. �And who is my neighbour�  He wanted to justify himself. This is the problem. Having been confronted by Jesus words he should have cried out for mercy and grieved for his sin. Like the tax collector in Luke 18 he should have cried out �God have mercy on me, a sinner� (Lk 1813) But instead he wanted to justify himself. He knew he did not love God perfectly. He knew he needed to repent. He knew he needed God�s incredible mercy. But backed into a corner he denies the pangs of conscience and maintains the deception. He publically presents a face that is different to the truth and wants to pretend all is well and hide in theology. 

In reply Jesus talked about the famous parable of the Good Samaritan in verse 30-35. A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. The road really does go down as Jerusalem approximates to three-thousand feet above sea level, Jericho approximates nine hundred to a thousand feet below sea level so it's a 4,000 foot drop in 17 miles, so it's pretty severe.  A winding tough path where robbers can hide. They took all the belongings from him. They robbed him of all his money, cash card and mobile phone. They did not stop there. They ripped him of his clothes. They beat him. They left him for dead.

At that time, a priest happened to be going down the same road. When he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. After a while, a Levite came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. A priest was a religious leader and a Levite was serving God in the temple. Both of them were full time servants of God. But they passed by on the other side when they saw a man who was robbed.   

Yet how different was the Samaritan As he travelled he saw him. He took pity on him. Though he was in a rush and knew the risks of stopping but he went to him and bandaged him wounds. He poured oil and wine from his bag onto the wounds as an emergency care. Then he put him on his own donkey and brought him to an inn and took care of him. But how much care Look at verse 35, �The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.' Two silver coins are two denarii. The cheapest form of inn would cost one thirty-second of a denarii.  So he gave him enough for perhaps 64 days room and board.  If it was a better inn then perhaps enough for a month. And even then he says he will give more! This man�s love was lavish. 

Having told the story Jesus asked, �Which of these three do you think was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of robbers�  Through gritted teeth the man replied �The one who had mercy on him� (37). Notice that he could not even say �Samaritan� because he disliked them so much.  What does Jesus then say He repeats, just as he did before in verse 28, �Go and do likewise.�  Some think of this story as a call to be neighbourly and to love our enemies but Jesus is talking about something far more - the way to eternal life. You want eternal life  How are you going to get it  Love God with all your heart, all you soul, all you mind and all you strength.  But of course the man could not. And if he thought he could love his neighbour then it�s clear that he can't love like this man did. You will never love like this man.  There may be a rare occasion when you give a homeless person �20 or �50. Maybe you have let a homeless person sleep in your house for a night or two. But what Jesus is calling for here is a kind of limitless lavish love toward anybody and everybody and always.  We love ourselves like this.  We don't love others like this.  By the way, that's how God loves us. 

So Jesus is helping the expert in the law with one more opportunity to say Jesus, I don't love like that.  I can't love like that.  I never will love like that.  I'll never get in the Kingdom, if that's what's required.� Jesus wants the man to stop pretending and admit it that he is a sinner in need of God�s mercy.

And where are we Do you love God with all your heart Do you love your friends with this lavish love let alone your enemies If this is what it requires for me to get in heaven, I'm not getting there.  Yet this is how many believers try and live. When we come to Jesus we confess our sin. But as believers we still sin. And like this man we try and justify ourselves. �It�s not that bad. Other�s do it.� We try and live by law � bible law, ministry law and the result is that we get tired. It does not work. Yesterday some of us went to the Men�s Convention. There were 4000 men in the Royal Albert Hall talking of faithfulness � faithfulness to work, faithfulness to family, to church and to mission. Mark Driscoll from American said �the world is asking - will the church in London survive Will it continue� He said many live under the myth that London is harder than most. He hears many people say �Aghh London is too hard. It�s too difficult�. But the truth is everywhere is hard because sinners are everywhere. His diagnosis Why does mission die I was struck by his response. He said �A lack of repentance�. The first of Martin Luther�s 95 theses on the Wittenberg Gate was that a Christian�s whole life should be one of repentance. His whole life. Why Because for our whole life we are sinners in need of grace.

Jesus was trying to help the expert in the law realize his sin and calling him to repent. This is the way of eternal life. Not just long life but rich abundant life. Eternal life is a life that is full of light without the shadow of sin and fatalism, nihilism and death. Eternal life is the life of Christ � of happiness, freshness and passion free from the wrath of God. If we have lost some of this rather than looking for what the missing activity might be let�s listen to Jesus and come to him in repentance and seek his grace. 

II. Martha and Mary (38-42)

Look at verses 38-39 �As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.  She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.� As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village. There Martha and Mary were living. Martha opened her home to Jesus. That sounds great � but it was not easy to open their home to Jesus. He was always with twelve disciples who liked to eat. Besides them there were women who followed and various needy demanding people. Serving Jesus meant serving those people as well. But Martha did not calculate. She wanted to invite Jesus. She planned dinner and started to prepare for it. But while she was working hard in the kitchen, Mary was listening to Jesus at the feet of Jesus. She concentrated on Jesus� word and enjoying his company.

We tend to read this and think Mary was right and Martha was overly fussy and should just sit down and listen. But let�s face it without Martha there would be no meal and nothing would get done. We cannot sit around all day just reading the bible and praying. 

So what�s the problem Look at verse 40. �But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that head to be made, She came to him and asked, �Lord, don�t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself Tell her to help me!� Martha was busy minded because of the many things she had to prepare. Martha�s heart was full of complaint and anger toward her sister.  Finally she complained. �Lord, don�t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself Tell her to help me!� 

At times when we are busy we look round and criticise others who are doing less. When Martha first invited Jesus into her home, her heart was full of a genuine desire to please Jesus and serve him. But through the demands of the work this disappeared. Her heart became full of complaint, criticism of others, judgmentalism and annoyance. 

How did Jesus help Martha Look at verses 41-42 ��Martha, Martha,� the Lord answered, �you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.�� Jesus loved Martha. He did not want lots of food if it was without love. More than this Jesus said that Mary chose what is better and it would not be taken away from her. What is the thing that Mary chose It was to sit at the feet of Jesus and listen to him. While Martha concentrated on making food she forgot the main point � Jesus. Jesus said that Mary chose what was better. Why was that better When we concentrate on Jesus and listen to his word, we can truly love Jesus and love others. When Martha concentrated on making food rather than Jesus, the result was that she lost Jesus and lost her love for Jesus. She could not even love her closest sister. She became busy minded and worried and anxious. In the end, she lost the joy of eternal life even though she was serving Jesus. 

Why does Luke place this story next to that of the expert in the law and his question of eternal life What is the common thing in the expert in the Law and Martha Both were serving God but they did not have the joy of eternal life. I am not saying that Martha was not born again � its seems she was � but she lost the joy, privilege and excitement of eternal life because she stopped listening carefully to Jesus� words. The expert in the law knew a lot about the bible but he was not listening in such a way to find his sin and repent.

This is the question for us. Martin Luther said a Christian�s whole life is one of repentance. Many here have moving life testimonies about how we met Jesus and cried at his grace. This is wonderful and right. But to grow in eternal life and enjoy Jesus means a life of repentance. There are many things to do. But most of all, we must choose to sit at the feet of Jesus and listen to him. From listening to Jesus� word and repenting before him, all grace will flow.  May Jesus mercy be with us all. May we have ears to hear and enjoy the gift of eternal life that only Jesus brings.
