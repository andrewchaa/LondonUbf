2010 Acts 19

ALL PEOPLE MAY BECOME WHAT I AM

Acts 24:1-26:32
Key verse: Acts 26:29
Paul replied, "Short time or long'I pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains." 
In the last lecture, Paul was tried before the Jews and testified to the gospel. In today's message, he was tried before the Roman governor Felix (chapter 24), then Festus (chapter 25) and King Agrippa (chapter 26). Through this Jesus' earlier words to his disciples were fulfilled, 'On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.' (Mt 10:18). How did Paul defend himself and testify to the gospel at the trials? Let's think about our God who led Paul to Rome through all these persecutions. 
Look at verse 1. 'Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.' Paul had testified in the Sanhedrin. The Jews had decided to assassinate him and because he was a Roman citizen, the commander Claudius Lysias sent Paul to Caesarea in order to protect him. Felix the Roman governor read the letter from the Lysias and put Paul in prison while investigating the case. Five days later, the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus to bring their charges against Paul. Ananias was so determined to condemn Paul in the Roman court that he brought an expert in Roman law. The trial began with Paul being brought before the prosecution with Felix sitting as Judge. Then Tertullus presented his charges. 
Look at verse 2, 3. 'We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation. Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.' Tertullus started with excessive flattery. He said that because of Felix's excellent reign the country had been so much improved and the people had enjoyed peace. Yet according to the Jewish historian Josephus, Felix used his position for evil'seeking bribes and women. He mercilessly killed off his opposition. Yet of course Tertullus tried to gain his favour by flattering him. Then the Lawyer got to the point. 
He accused Paul with three charges. First, for causing  riots ( political riots). Look at verse 5a. 'We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world.' Tertullus accused Paul of being an insurrectionist and a trouble maker but with no evidence. Yet he first presented this sensitive charge of rioting to make Felix feel uneasy'as political riots were against Rome itself. At that time, Rome was fairly tolerant over religious matters in the colonies, but was merciless with any kind of riot. So just with in Jesus' trial, Paul was accused before the Roman governor for political unrest when originally in the Sanhedrin he had been accused of blasphemy. 
Second, he was charged as a ringleader of the Nazarene sect. Look at verse 5b. A sect means a group that goes astray from the orthodox norm. The word Tertullus used can also mean a group that was against Rome. Tertullus knew very well that in the Roman court he couldn't get a conviction on a religious issue, so he intended that Felix would interpret this word 'sect' politically. Here we can see that they wanted to accuse Paul as a political criminal. 
Third he goes on, '' and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.' (6) The matter about temple would not have been regarded as very important in the Roman court, so he talked about it very briefly. If however it had been in the Sanhedrin, Tertullus would have presented this charge against Paul as of first importance. 
Felix gave Paul a chance to defend himself (10). Paul answered each of the charges. First, about the riots (11-13). Paul didn't have enough time to plan a riot because he had been in Jerusalem only for 12 days. Nobody had seen him disputing with others or stirring up the crowd. He was alone when he was arrested. The uproar was not because of Paul's followers but rather because of the Jews from the province of Asia who accused him. Second, about the Nazarene sect (14-16). As for this , Paul boldly testified that he was a follower of the Way (of Christianity) which the Jews called a sect. He explained that this faith was not a cult of Judaism but the same faith in the same God of their forefathers, the law and the Prophets. Paul had the same hope in the God of the resurrection of the righteous and the wicked. Through this Paul testified that Christianity was not a betrayal to Judaism but the fulfilment of Judaism. Third, the matter of the temple (17-21). Tertullus said that Paul desecrated the temple but Paul had stayed there quietly for 7 days for his purification ceremony. He had come to Jerusalem to hand over the offering from the Gentile churches not to stir up a political riot. He was arrested during his purification and his only crime was that he believed in the resurrection of the dead as he had testified in the Sanhedrin earlier. Paul clearly testified that his only sin was that he believed in the resurrection of the dead, which is, the resurrection of Jesus. He defended himself that he was being accused unfairly by the Jews and had done nothing to be condemned by the Roman law. 
Look at verse 22. 'Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. "When Lysias the commander comes," he said, "I will decide your case."' This was merely to delay his decision and in fact it meant that he judged Paul innocent. He had already read the letter from the commander and knew that the commander also believed Paul's innocence. But because he was aware of the Jews' extreme emotion and also so that he could see if he could get a bribe from Paul who appeared to be carrying a significant amount of money as offerings, he kept Paul in prison. Yet he gave Paul some freedom and let his friends supply his needs. He often called for Paul and listened to him about faith in Christ Jesus along with his Jewish wife, Drusilla. Rather than flattering Felix, Paul's message was direct about judgement and repentance. But the governor didn't repent and left Paul in prison for a long time. Yet this was God's time for Paul to prepare his Roman ministry by devoting himself to the word of God and prayer. Two years later, Festus succeeded Felix as the governor (27). 
Chapter 25. The new governor Festus came to his office in Caesarea and went up to Jerusalem on his third day in office. It must have been his priority to know the region he was in charge of and build good relations with the local authorities. The Jewish religious leaders knew that the new governor would be keen to gain their favour and used it to attack Paul. They had been looking for a way to kill Paul for the last 2 years. They used the fact that Festus didn't know anything about Paul to request a trial in Jerusalem (2). They had planned to assassinate Paul on the way to Jerusalem (3).  
Yet Festus was not a push-over. He refused their request for two reasons. First, there was no danger of Paul's escape as long as he was imprisoned in Caesarea (4a) and second, Festus himself was going back to Caesarea soon so there was no need to move him to Jerusalem (4b). Instead, he suggested that the Jewish representatives come to Caesarea and have a trial there (5). He might have thought that moving Paul to Jerusalem would be too much work and it wouldn't look good if he opened a trial for a Roman citizen in Jerusalem. Anyway, Paul survived another fatal situation because of Festus' alert judgement. 
Festus went down to Caesarea after staying in Jerusalem 8-10 days. Paul's accusers went down with him. The trial began the next day. This was Paul's third official trial (22:30; 24:1-22) and he had to defend himself once more against groundless accusations. Look at verse 7. When Paul appeared, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove.' The Jews didn't bring a lawyer this time but instead brought many people to create an intimidating atmosphere. Yet again their accusations were the same as Tertullus had presented two years ago and even though the charges were serious, they couldn't provide any evidence. Even if the charges were true, it would have been very difficult to gather fresh evidence after two years. Paul testified that he didn't commit any sin against the Jewish law, the temple or against Caesar. Festus heard both parties but couldn't make a judgement. He should have released Paul as innocent because the prosecution charges were groundless. Yet, He needed to build up a positive and cooperating relationship with the Jews. If he went against them from the beginning of his regime, his reign would be very troublesome. He tried to earn the Jews' heart by asking Paul if he would go to Jerusalem to stand trial there (9). 
Look at verse 10,11. 'Paul answered: "I am now standing before Caesar's court, where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well. If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!"' Paul reminded Festus that his suggestion was against the Roman law. There was no reason for a Roman citizen who was already standing in the Roman court to stand trial in the Sanhedrin which had no right to try a Roman citizen. He also testified to his innocence. Paul was not merely trying to save his life but also testifying that what the Jews were doing, trying to kill an innocent man, was not just. Paul knew very well that if he went down to Jerusalem according to Festus' suggestion, he would be assassinated. He decided to appeal to Caesar to get a fair trial and to get closer to his calling to testify to the gospel in Rome. At that time, any Roman citizen could appeal to Caesar from the lower courts. At this, Festus consulted his council and decided to send Paul to Caesar (12). Festus could have freed Paul as innocent. But he decided to send him to Caesar because he wanted a smooth relationship with the Jews and also he wanted to hand over this matter so that he wouldn't have to take the political risk. Through this, in a very unexpected way, the door was opened for Paul to go to Rome. This was God's amazing behind the scenes planning, controlling men's hearts, confounding the Jews' evil schemes (Ps 33:10) and using the Gentile rulers as his instrument to do his will. 
Look at verse 13. 'A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.' King Agrippa was a grand grandson of Herod the Great and his full name was Marcus Julius Agrippa II. He was appointed as king over Palestine Calcis in about AD 50. Then more regions including Galilee came under his reign. He was the last king who ruled when Judah was destroyed in about AD 70. He was highly favoured by Caesar and used to visit the new governors and build a friendly relationship. He came to visit Festus with his wife Bernice (Drusilla's sister). Festus talked to him about Paul'the proceedings of his trial and that he appealed to Caesar. King Agrippa was very interested and wanted to hear Paul. So Festus brought him before King Agrippa. 
Look at verse 23. 'The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the leading men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.' Agrippa and Bernice came in with great pomp in order to show off their wealth and authority before the people. The high ranking officers and the leading men also came in, no doubt in their luxurious clothes. The official trial was already finished, so this was a hearing for Paul alone. While King, Queen, the Roman officials and the high ranking people were displaying their majesty, Paul was brought in in chains. What a contrast! Probably he was wearing his old clothes, he had been in prison for two years, and we don't know in what condition. Many in the audience would have looked down at Paul with contempt. Festus first explained in detail how Paul had come to appeal to Caesar. Then Agrippa gave his permission to Paul to speak. Paul motioned with his hands to quieten the audience and begin his defence (26:1b). 
Paul said that he considered himself fortunate to defend his case before King Agrippa who was well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Then he testified to how he was brought up and lived as a most strict Jew. Paul testified that the reason he was accused was because of his faith in the resurrection of the dead. It was what the Jews also believed and longed for while serving God. The problem was the different views about Jesus of Nazareth. Paul testified that Jesus was the promised Messiah whom the Jews had been waiting for and the evidence was his resurrection. In the past Paul himself had regarded believers in Jesus were an evil cult and had tried hard to get rid of them. He was so angry with them that he even went to a foreign city Damascus to persecute them with letters from the chief priests. However, on the way there, he had met the risen Jesus. It wasn't a psychological event that had happened in his mind because all his companions saw the light and fell to the ground. The risen Jesus gave him a mission, saying he would send Paul to Israel and to the Gentiles so that they might open their eyes and turn from darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God, receiving the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. What Paul had done so far was all from his obedience to this command of God. But the Jews didn't accept Paul's message of repentance and that was why he was seized and became a prisoner. 
Look at verse 24. When Paul spoke this far, Festus, ignorant of faith and knowledge of God, shouted at Paul that he had gone insane. He thought Paul studied too much and became mad. Yet Paul was not insane. He was telling the truth. Paul asked King Agrippa if he believed in the Prophets. King Agrippa wouldn't have been able to say no, as a Jew and the king of the Jews who was officially the protector of the temple. Paul's point here was that if he believed in the Prophets, he also should believe Jesus as the Messiah and in accordance his resurrection. Yet Agrippa cynically answered that Paul was trying to make him a Christian. 
What was Paul's answer to him? Look at verse 29. 'Paul replied, "Short time or long'I pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains."' Paul was not intimidated before these rulers of the world, these governors and kings, but boldly testified to the gospel. He knew that his life was being used much more preciously than that of Agrippa, or Festus or any of the high officials even though in human terms he was a prisoner. Furthermore, he had compassion for them and earnestly wanted that they become Christians like him except for the chains. He wanted them to know and have the same glorious life as he had, with the grace of the forgiveness of sins, the promise of eternal life and the heavenly calling. He invited them to true spiritual freedom by testifying to Jesus' resurrection as an envoy of God and a servant of Christ Jesus. Paul was truly free as a servant of Jesus. 
When he said this lifting the chains on his hands, the people must have been struck in their consciences. Paul testified to the gospel boldly and clearly before Agrippa, Festus and the officials. This message was his farewell message in Israel. Though on the surface he testified to Agrippa, in fact he was giving this message to all of Israel. All the people who were there knew that Paul was innocent. Paul didn't go to Rome because he was a criminal but because he had to fulfil God's vision of pioneering Rome. 

From this passage I see the amazing way God works to fulfil his salvation purpose. Paul was innocent and his imprisonment was unjust yet God used this to ensure his safety, give him time with God's word, and clear his path to Rome. His trial meant he could testify to Governors and kings. But two things in particular strike me about Paul. First, that he was above all a shepherd, who though being judged, cared for the salvation of men like Agrippa, Festus and Felix. He could have felt bitterness towards them, but instead he loved them and served them with the gospel truth. He told Felix about justice and God's judgement, he wanted him to repent. He always at every opportunity preached to them the resurrection of Jesus, and his personal testimony of God's grace. He wanted them to share in this same grace of forgiveness.
Which brings me to the second quality I learn from Paul: his dignity as a royal priest. It is a very visual moment, the contrast between Paul's chains and Agrippa's pomp. Yet there is no irony when Paul tells the king 'I want you to be like me.' He meant it from the bottom of his heart. If Paul thought from a human point of view he might have felt shame in chains before the glory of this king, but Paul felt great pride. Sometimes we can feel a little ashamed before the pomp of proud UCL students, they seem to have everything and they can despise us as not worthy of their attention.Yet like Paul I need to remember how beautiful it is to God to preach the gospel, how much heaven honours our witness. Instead of feeling shame or humiliation I need to feel great pride, not for myself but the grace of Jesus to call me as his servant. The man with real freedom in that court room was the man standing in chains, because he was not bound by the worldly desire, he was not chained by sin or what people thought of him, instead he knew Jesus' forgiveness personally and knew his value as a witness. Maybe secretly Agrippa and Festus must have envied his freedom.
In conclusion, through today's passage, Paul was tried before Felix, Festus and Agrippa and proven to be innocent. God enabled the gospel to be preached by means of the Jews' persecution and the trials before the Gentiles, and led Paul to Rome. In all these events, Paul always boldly testified to the gospel. He was a warrior of the gospel who boldly preached the gospel to anyone anytime. He knew the glory of the evangelist. He had a strong sense of dignity in Christ which no one could crush. He was in chains but he enjoyed true freedom. May God help each of us to be used like Paul, as a true freeman and bold witness of the gospel on the campus.
