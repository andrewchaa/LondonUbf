2011 Luke 26

THE FATHER�S GREAT LOVE

Luke 15:1-32

Key verse 15:20 
�So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.�

The story of the Prodigal Son in today�s passage is sometimes called the gospel within the gospel because from it we can learn the whole gospel. But the chapter begins with Jesus speaking to a group of public sinners whilst the Pharisees stand to one side and mutter about him. Through the three parables Jesus tells the Pharisees he seeks to explain the love of God which leads him to spend time with sinners in order that they can enter the kingdom of God. As you look at these parables we can see more and more deeply how much God loves each one of us. My prayer is that we would realise that there is no sin so terrible that God will not forgive it and welcome us home and that in knowing the love of God we would have the desire and sense of responsibility to share this love to others.
I.  Jesus� love for lost sinners
Look at verses 1 and 2; �Now the tax collectors and �sinners� were all gathering round to hear him. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, �This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them.� The tax collectors and �sinners� were gathering round (1) to hear Jesus because welcomed (2) them and ate (2) with them. Jesus was glad to see these people, he told them about the kingdom of heaven and enjoyed spending time eating with them. 
These two verses show us God�s heart for sinners. Jesus loved the tax collectors and sinners and he wanted them to receive the kingdom of heaven. In turn these people wanted to be with Jesus because they understood that they were sinners, they knew they were welcomed by Jesus and they could tell that Jesus had the answer to their sin problem. The Pharisees were muttering about this but Jesus loves all sinners so he also gave Pharisees an opportunity to enter the kingdom of heaven by telling them three parables to help them understand God�s heart for sinners. 
The first is the parable of the lost sheep, look at verse 4; �Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?� Sheep were a valuable commodity and a shepherd would not want to lose one. However a shepherd with ninety-nine sheep might be expected to stay and look after the ninety-nine rather than to risk losing more whilst looking for the one who has wondered off. The heart of this shepherd is different though. He leaves the ninety-nine to look for the one lost sheep and keeps looking for it until he finds it. This shepherd perseveres because he loves his sheep and wants all 100 of them to be safe. 
So what happens when he finds the sheep? Look at verses 5 and 6; �And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbours together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.' This man is so joyful because he has found his sheep. We cannot imagine what a found sheep party might be like but this man was so happy to have his missing sheep back that he called all his friends and neighbours together to celebrate its return. 
Look at verse 7; �I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.� Jesus wanted the Pharisees to understand that God loves each person individually. He wanted them to understand that when one repents and comes back to God, whether they be a tax collector, a prostitute or a self-righteous Pharisee then God and all heaven rejoice. 
The parable of the lost coin also emphasises God�s heart for lost sinners, look at verse 8; �Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Does she not light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?� This coin would not have been worth much but it would have formed part of this woman�s dowry therefore it was very important to her. Like the shepherd the woman works hard searching everywhere for her coin until it is found and like the shepherd she also throws a party when she has found it. Look at verse 10; �In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.� It is God who celebrates in the presence of the angels when one person repents of their sin.
The Pharisees should have learned from Jesus that they were the shepherds and the woman. As the spiritual leaders of Israel they ought to have had compassion on those who had a broken relationship with God. They ought to have been persevering in the search for those who were lost and they ought to have been celebrating each time a lost sinner came back to God. But we see that all they were doing was muttering about Jesus.
Those of us who know God personally, experienced God�s love when we were saved. God had compassion on us, pursued us and celebrated when we returned to him. He wants us to have the same attitude to our nation. Do we share Jesus� heart for lost sinners or are we like the Pharisees looking at people as unforgivable? When we go to UCL we may judge students thinking that they are spiritually ignorant, rude or too foolish to accept our offer of the kingdom of heaven. But instead of judging we need to have compassion on them and persevere to bring them into the kingdom of heaven.
In particular UCL students look very confident and happy. Yet underneath many of them are asking questions about their lives. They want to know what the point of life is, why they are studying so hard and what the purpose of getting a job and raising a family is. The most tragic people take their own lives because they cannot find an answer to the meaninglessness they feel. A friend of mine was telling me of a guy he trained with in the first week of his job. He was a Cambridge maths graduate with a master�s degree. He was a nice guy who people liked but two weeks later he had killed himself. When we hear stories like this we are heartbroken to think of the wasted lives. If we think about the coin in the second parable, it would have had no value if it had been remained lost. But when the woman found it, it became part of her dowry and she could use it to enable her to marry. The meaning of life is to live to glorify God and until people learn this their lives have meaning and no purpose. People need God, it is our responsibility as shepherds to the students of this nation to go out and find those whom God is looking for. To do this we need to have God�s heart and Jesus told a third parable to help the Pharisees and us to understand more fully God�s heart for lost sinners. 
II. The parable of the lost son
Look at verses 11 and 12; �Jesus continued: There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them.� This parable has a father and two sons and at the beginning of the story the younger of the two sons makes this extraordinary request to his father that he give him his share in the inheritance. This was an insult and it amounted to wishing that his father was dead. Why did the younger son make this request? 
Verse 13 says; �Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.� The son was looking for freedom. He was tired of having to do what his father told him. Maybe his father always made him do his homework and help on the farm. Maybe as he looked into the future, all the younger brother could see was a life of farming and toil just like his father�s. The son thought that he would rather live a life which was free of all these things so he took his father�s money and went off to a distant country to indulge in wild living. The son thought that finally, now that he was away from his father he was free.
Why did the father allow his son to go and why did he allow him to take the money? The answer to the first question is that the father had no choice. Above all the father wanted his son to love him and if the father held him back his son would have grown to hate him. He gave his son the money because he hoped that one day his son would come back therefore he wanted the last thing his son remembered of his father to be an act of love and know that he could return home.
In raising our own children we need to invest spiritually as they are growing up. Then if they decide to turn away from God, the word of God is already planted in them and they will be able to come back. To raise our children in this way is a blessing to them but most young people today have not received the word of God from their parents. A few weeks ago I met a student who said that he had only heard of the Bible and that he thought it was a book about Adam and Eve. If this is the level of spiritual awareness amongst students, when difficult times come they will not know what it is they need. Again, this is why we need to be at UCL sharing the word of God with people so that they can find what is missing in their lives. 
Verses 14 to 16 tell us what happened to the son after he had squandered all his wealth; �After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no-one gave him anything.� In spite of all his efforts to be free the son discovered that he was poor, hungry, thirsty and lonely, his freedom was gone and he was forced to hire himself out like a slave. 
Look at verses 17 to 19; �When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.' This is where the younger son repents of his sin. Complete repentance involves three things; acknowledging our sin, feeling genuine remorse and making a decision to live differently in the future. If we only acknowledge and feel remorse for our sins we have not fully repented and we remain in the pig pen. Making a decision changes our lives. This is where the father�s gift to his son has its effect. Because the son remembers how well he was treated by his father. Consequently he comes to his senses and realises that true freedom is actually with his father. The younger son teaches us that true freedom is not found by running away from God but by being in a relationship with God.
Meanwhile the father had eagerly waited for his son to come back. For years he couldn�t sleep properly. He wondered about his son, he prayed for him and waited for him to repent and come back. When he heard news about him, his heart was troubled. His love for his son didn�t change over time. This father�s heart waited just as God�s heart waits. 
Look at verse 20; �So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.� Again in verse 20 Jesus is showing us the nature of God�s love. We see the father�s perseverance, compassion, emotion and joy, hugging and kissing the dirty and worn out lost son. This is so different to the Pharisees� view of God. They saw God as legalistic, angry and condemning. But here Jesus shows us God�s unconditional love. God accepts us passionately and joyfully, no matter how dirty and disgusting a sinner we are. All we have to do is repent and come back to him. In verse 21 the son says; �Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' He is right but the father says nothing about his sin, instead he wants to celebrate the return of his lost son. Therefore he tells his servants to put the best robe on him, a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Then he instructs them to kill the fattened calf for a feast. �For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found' (22-24). Without God we are dead in our sin but when we come back he forgives us and gives us the right to be his sons and daughters. God has made us heirs of the kingdom of God. This is the amazing love of God. I pray that we would not underestimate this but clearly understand the fullness and depth of the love of God for each one of us. 
Look at verse 25; �Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.� The older brother was a hard working man and he had spent the day in the fields. Now as he returned home he heard the celebration for his brother�s return and asked what was happening. When the servant told him; �The older brother became angry and refused to go in.� Again we can see the father�s love here. Verse 28 says; ��his father went out and pleaded with him�� to come in. Yet the older brother�s response is this; �Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!� (29-30). 
The older son was outraged at the father�s love for his younger brother. The older brother represents the Pharisees. Jesus was telling them that their outrage at his welcome for the tax collectors and �sinners� was just like that of the older brother. The older brother could not be joyful with his father or his brother. His problem was that just like his brother, although he worked hard, all he wanted was his father�s material wealth. Both brothers became slaves (29), one because he tried to run away from his father and the other because he worked for his father out of a self-righteous sense of duty. The older brother had a sense of entitlement; he thought he deserved his father�s love. The truth is that we are all sinners and no one deserves the love that God shows us. Instead we receive God�s love as an act of grace. The father loved his older son and pleaded with him to come in to the party. Likewise, Jesus was pleading with the Pharisees to repent and enter the kingdom of heaven and yet they were refusing to come in. 
The challenge for many of us is to realise the depth of God�s love for us. Maybe we think our sins are too repetitive or too terrible for God to forgive us. What Jesus wants us to understand is that God�s love is so great that there is no sin that he will not forgive as soon as we repent. We can compare God�s love to the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is vast. If I spent the next ten minutes describing its proportions to you, you might have some idea of how big it is. But in reality, unless you spent years sailing backwards and forwards across it you would not really understand the scale or the nature of that ocean. I cannot adequately describe God�s love to you, we have to go out and experience it through repenting and returning to God in order to really understand how great God�s love is. 
The tax collectors and sinners were gathering round to hear Jesus because they could sense the love of God in him. These were people with ears to hear and because of this they received from Jesus the good news of the kingdom of heaven. We can be like Jesus if we have the love of God in our hearts and people will know because it will show on our faces. Just as a child who is loved is happy and other children want to play with them, a Christian who really knows the love of God is joyful and people want to gather round them to hear the word of God. So the challenge of this passage is not just to ask ourselves, am I an older or a younger son. The challenge is also two questions. The first is; do I really know God�s forgiving love? The second is to ask ourselves do I have God�s heart in me to attract lost sinners and teach them the word of God. God loves every lost sinner in this nation. Each person needs the word of God to solve their sin problem. God has given us his word and it is our responsibility to preach the gospel to them. If our hearts are like the Pharisees, slaving dutifully for God we will be powerless to serve. But if our hearts are filled with the love of God  people will be attracted to us and we can share with them the word of God and the love of God. 
In conclusion, God loves us so much. When we were lost he came looking for us until he found us and brought us back to him. God is so full of compassion that he forgives all sin and rejoices when lost sinners repent and come back to him. I pray that each one of us would consider again our relationship with God and ask ourselves if we really know the love of God? I pray that we would be so filled with God�s love that like Jesus we become magnetic, attracting people to hear the word of God and be saved. Amen
