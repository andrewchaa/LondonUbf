WISDOM TO USE WORLDLY WEALTH
Luke 16:1-31
Key verse 16:9
I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.
When I saw that I was due to give this message on chapter 16, my heart sank a little. I thought, �Oh Dear, It�s about money. I feel I am no good with money, I don�t know much about it, Paul knows more, I don�t feel qualified to speak about it.� But then I saw Jesus is teaching his disciples about money and wealth, and my attitude needed to change. Jesus wanted his disciples to learn from the shrewd manager, and as his disciples I need to learn shrewdness. So my personal prayer for me and all of you is that we learn from the shrewd manager.

 People in this world struggle to earn money but don�t think much about how they should use that money. This world is full of wisdom on how to earn money, there are so many books about wealth creation, but more importantly as Jesus� disciples we need to understand what money is for and how to use it steward it and not be ruled by it. Through today�s passage may God help us to learn wisdom in using money so that we may overcome materialism in this generation and prepare for our eternal future. May God help us to please Jesus in our attitude and use of money. 

I.	The parable of shrewd manager (1-8)

Look at verses 1-2. ?esus told his disciples: There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.  So he called him in and asked him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.� One rich man had a manager. He trusted him and put him in charge of his large wealth. He expected the manager to look after it and make a profit as a faithful and wise manager. However, soon he realised that the manager � instead of looking after his property well �wasted his possessions. The rich man heard what happened and decided to fire him. He called the manager and rebuked him. 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.' The manager had nothing to say to defend himself. 
But what was his concern? Look at verse 3. �The manager said to himself, 'What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg.� He regretted what he had done but now it dawned on him his future was in trouble. He knew his boss wouldn�t give him a reference, and he didn�t have any friends or rich relatives to bail him out. There wasn�t the welfare state in those days. He realised that there was nothing he could do other than to beg. After thinking and thinking, what conclusion did he reach? Look at verses 4-7. �I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses. So he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' 'Eight hundred gallons of olive oil,' he replied. The manager told him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred.'  Then he asked the second, 'And how much do you owe?' 'A thousand bushels of wheat,' he replied. He told him, 'Take your bill and make it eight hundred� 800 hundred gallons of olive oil is about three thousand litres, which is about a year�s wages in real terms. That is a lot of money! We can think how these people would be thankful to the manager for reducing the debt? I would be that guy�s friend if he reduced my debt by that much! But how did the master see it? Look at verse 8. �The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.� There is admiration in the master here, not for the manager�s dishonesty, but for his shrewdness. �For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.� He commended the manager not because what he did was moral but because it was shrewd. Shrewdness is not often so obviously linked to holiness. Shrewdness can seem more appropriate to the things of the world than the things of God. Particularly with money, Christians can sometimes find the issue of money distasteful and not spiritual.
Yet Jesus here is saying to his disciples, �I want you to learn shrewdness when it comes to money.� That worldly, even dishonest people have something to teach you here. (Not the dishonest part but the shrewd part!) I was thinking about shrewdness, and it made me think of the TV series The Apprentice, with Alan Sugar. He is the guy who is known for his shrewdness, and gets young ambitious managers to compete with each other, using their talents their initiative, their team work in order to get a financial result. Sugar isn�t interested in their excuses, he wants to see whether what they do works. Jesus also wanted his disciples to be shrewd, to use their heads their talents, their imagination and their initiative when it came to money.
So in what aspects, was the manager shrewd? First, he realized the crisis and acted upon it quickly. How had he lived in the past? He had not been wise and wasted the master�s wealth. He had sought only temporary benefit. He was probably lazy. Finally, he was fired from his job. Many people even when they face such a crisis still can�t wake up from their spiritual slumber. However, the manager in this passage, when he realized that he had lived foolishly, didn�t just despair or continue to live in the same way. Instead he got up quickly, used his initiative and prepared for the future. The master valued the manager�s shrewdness to overcome the crisis quickly and prepare for the future. 
Second, he was wise because he earned friends through money. He could have prepared his future by other ways too. He could have gone to the country side or he could even steal the money from the master and run away. However, he earned friends with his master�s money. Of course, this isn�t moral, it�s dishonest. But the point here is that he understood the money is only temporary whereas good friends are really valuable and forever. He started to use his money to help people. The fact that he used the money on friends is what needs to be commended. He was very wise. In the time of need, there is nothing more valuable than good friends. 

Jesus said �For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.� How shrewd are people in this world? They are shrewd in that they prepare for their future shrewdly. They have a clear target and like Alan Sugar they do what they need to get results and make it happen. Still today, we can see how much people in this world overcome hardships to prepare for a better future. 

But what about us? The difference between Christians and people in the world is not that we shouldn�t be shrewd, but rather that our long term direction is different. We know our future is eternal, and therefore everything we do in this life and the way we spend money should be in view of our eternal reward. The question is are we preparing for this future well? It can be easy to fall into the pattern of the world, to forget about the long term and just think about short term comforts. We can become spiritually lazy and worldly in our desires, hopes and ambitions and this is very often reflected in the way we spend and use money. We can either spend money in a way that furthers God�s kingdom and serves others, or misuse it for our own pleasure,? The manager became alert and shrewd when he was given the shock of the sack. In the same way, as children of the light we need to be spiritually alert each day and prepare for our eternal future.

How then did Jesus command the sons of light to use their wealth? Look at verse 9a. �I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves� Jesus teaches us that that is the best way for us to use the money and prepare the future. When we do so, he promise that �so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.� This verse is showing that the friends means friends and people of God. This means that we should use our money in preparing the eternal dwellings � in particular in saving souls, raising up disciples and serving God�s people.
We are each, in a sense, managers of our life, time, money, talents given by God. God wants us to become a good and faithful manager. He wants to know that life, time, money, talent � are not our own but what God has entrusted us to look after. We are only managers. In particular God doesn�t want us to waste the money on ourselves but to use it to earn friends in Christ. This is God�s will for us. If we only waste our wealth and only enjoy our own lives, he will say �What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.� All of us will face a time when we have to stand before God and enter our eternal dwellings. At that time, only the people who used worldly wealth to earn friends in Jesus will be proved wise. �I tell you, use your worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings. Jesus also says �in 1 Tim 6:17-19 �Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.�
Look at verse 10. �Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.� Jesus doesn�t want us to be confused and learn the wrong lesson from the dishonest manager. He wants us to understand being trustworthy is very important. Our attitude to even small responsibilities reveals our character and attitude. If we are not trustworthy with small things, we will also not be trustworthy with larger responsibilities. In particular, we need to be honest and trust worthy even with small amounts of money. 
Look at verse 11-12. �So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?� When we are trustworthy in small things, we can also be in charge of big, true riches. If someone can�t serve God faithfully even with worldly wealth how can God entrust someone with heavenly riches? God will put us in charge of heavenly riches when he sees our faithfulness in dealing with his worldly wealth. 
Look at verse 13. �No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.� No servant can have two masters. We can�t love both God and money. The one who loves money will not use the money for God and be stingy. Look at verse 14. �The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus.� They must have thought that they were serving God well even if they were rich. What did Jesus say? Look at verses 15-18. �He said to them, �You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men, but God knows your hearts. What is highly valued among men is detestable in God's sight. The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.�
  Jesus here pointed out the Pharisees inner heart problem. First of all, they lived before people and lived according to a worldly value system. Look at verse 15.  �You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men, but God knows your hearts. What is highly valued among men is detestable in God's sight� The Pharisees tried to look good before people but God knew their hearts. God knew their love for money and this world. God knew that they loved money but not God. This is what is detestable in God�s sight. 
Secondly they relied on the Law only and had no interest in heaven at all. Look at verses 16,17. The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law. Pharisees had a great pride that they are Abraham�s descendants and chosen people. People who accepted gospel � everyone was forcing his way into it through continual repentance and prayer. Yet, Pharisees became complacent and sought worldly pleasures. Jesus wanted them to repent their spiritual complacency and come back to him with repentance so that they may become his people. 
Third, their love of money revealed a deeper idolatry of pleasure. Look at verse 18. �Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.� Jesus knew Pharisees inner life. Though they looked holy outside, inwardly they were slaves of pleasures. Some of them disserted their wives and married another woman committing adultery. This is also the problem of the people who don�t have mission and live a habitual life of faith. When we have a clear mission, we can overcome our pleasure seeking desire and live a fruitful life. Otherwise, it is easy for us to choose pleasure-seeking as a goal of life and use God-given time, money and life to satisfy our sinful nature. God wants us to use our worldly wealth to gain friends. He wants us to use God-given money, life and everything to save souls and raise up his disciples. May he help us to devote our life in life-saving work among campus students so that we may overcome temptation and live a fruit-bearing life, preparing our eternal future. 
Third, The Rich Man and Lazarus (19-31) 
Jesus wanted to finally warn people who live for money. So, he gave this parable. There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. On the other hand, at his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores. He was longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. How wretched. Yet, (22-24), �The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.�� What was Abraham�s answer? (25, 26), �But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.�
What did the rich man then ask? (27-30), �He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.' 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' How did Abraham answer? He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'� The bible itself has enough power to make sinners to repent and return. If they do not repent even after hearing the gospel, even if people from hell come and witness they won�t listen.
 I pray that God may grant us the word of God each day so that we may repent and grow as faithful and trustworthy servants of God. May he help us to use the money not for our own comfort and pleasure but for gaining friends that will last eternally.
