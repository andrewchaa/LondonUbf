REMAIN IN THE TEACHING OF THE WORD

1John 2:1-29
Key verse 2:24
"See that what you have heard from the beginning remains a you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father."

In chapter 1, John wrote of having fellowship with the Father and with his son Jesus Christ. As an old man, he was writing to a church that was in danger of being influenced by Gnosticism which undermined the gospel and was a threat to the deep fellowship and love that believers could have with Jesus. As believers we want fellowship with our Father and his son, we want a fellowship that is powerful and fruitful and intimate. The question is how? In this passage John takes us through the some of the things we need to understand in order to maintain our vital fellowship with Jesus and God our Father. 

First, Come to Jesus honestly with our sin.

Look at verse 1. “My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defence— Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.” "My dear children," John writes you as a father, and I doubt there are many people who were older than him at the time. He is writing as an apostle, he is writing as a spiritual father, with the Shepherd love of someone who wants to protect and ensure Jesus’ flock continues to grow and flourish. He says "I write this so that you will not sin." "This" refers to the verses in the previous chapter where he was talking of the need to be honest about sin and confess it. Simply, if we claim we have no sin, then we are unable to come to Jesus to be forgiven and restored, and our fellowship with him suffers. 

One might think that this is a lesson that as believers we should have learned long ago. But it can be that as we go on in our faith, simple honesty and repentance can be harder. We can be tempted to think that we should have progressed further, and that is we are embarrassed by being tempted by the same sins as before. That can lead us to covering over our sins, or making excuses for them, suggesting they are not that bad. That is why hypocrisy is often the affliction of the older Christian as opposed to the one who has only recently come to Jesus. The fact is we are weak and we do sin but pretending we don’t only leads to inner guilt and self-condemnation, rather we need to come to Jesus. It is Jesus who understands us, loves us and forgives us, he speaks in our defence. As soon as we honestly come to him, our fellowship with him can be restored.

Look at verse 2. “He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.” Jesus became the atoning sacrifice for our sins. Jesus died on the cross for our sins. He was cursed by the law on behalf of us. He was punished for our sins and flogged for our sins. Jesus’ sacrifice wasn’t just for us but for the whole world. Any one if he accepts the gospel and comes to God, Jesus cleanses all their sins and purify them.

Second, obedience to his commands

Look at verse 3. “We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands.” Him refers to Jesus. If we keep Jesus' commands we know that we have come to know him. "Come to know him" here refers to a relationship with Jesus rather than just knowledge about him. Evidence of our knowing Jesus is demonstrated by our obedience to him. Again, John writes this knowing that we are weak and we still make mistakes and sin. However, our relationship to Jesus and his commands fundamentally change when we are born again. Before I met Jesus, I grew up in a Christian family and I knew how I should behave. Yet in my heart I didn't really want to obey, and I also had no power to obey. However, when I met Jesus personally, when I received him as my Christ, my relationship to his commands changed. I wanted to obey him, I wanted to please him, and even though I was weak I experienced that he helped me to live in obedience to him. If we know Jesus and believe in Jesus we do end up obeying him.

Now John was writing this to the believers because there were those amongst them, in particular Gnostics, who were claiming that they knew Jesus, but were not obeying his commands. Look at verse 4,5. " The man who says, I know him, but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him:” in last week's message Paul talked about the difference between relationship with Jesus, which we are brought into as soon as we believe him as the Christ, and fellowship which is a much deeper knowledge of God as we continue to walk with him. Here in verse 5, John describes how our fellowship with God deepens through obedience. He says, "If anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him.”Another translation for ‘complete’ is ‘perfect.’ As we obey Jesus, we experience more of God’s love and enter into a deeper fellowship with him.

Verse 6. “Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.” We must live as Jesus did. We should follow the example of Christ. It doesn’t mean that we should strive hard to be saved. Rather it means that those who are saved should live as Jesus did on earth out of thankfulness towards Jesus’ grace. This command is not legalistic. Rather walking as Jesus is our expression of our love for God.

Third, don’t hate but love your brother.

Look at verse 7 "Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard." John calls the recipients ‘Dear friends’. We can feel his love for them. John is about to talk about the new command Jesus gave to his disciples. But he says first it is not new but an old one which they have had since the beginning. What does this mean? It means that the new command of Jesus was in the Old Testament. In that sense it is not new but old. Lev 19:18 commanded that we should love our neighbour as ourself. Jesus said, “Love one another. As I have loved you, you also must love one another.” The command to love one another was the same, what was new was the standard of love that Jesus commands. Loving people as ourselves means that we love both ourselves and our brothers. But loving as Jesus loved us means that we love our brothers at the expense of our lives. The quality and level of love is different, it is a radical expansion. Jesus commanded us to love with self-denial and sacrifice. The standard is Jesus himself. Jesus showed us the love that dies for his friend and commands us to do the same. In Leviticus 19 the love was limited to “your people” namely the Jews. But Jesus told us to pray for those who persecute us and love our enemies, as he himself loved those who had nailed him to the cross. 

Verse 8. “Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.” He says this time that he is writing a new command whose truth is seen in Jesus and us. What does this mean? It means this truth of love is not just a theory or knowledge but something that is lived out and seen in Jesus and us. The new command was given by Jesus after he washed the feet of the disciples and showed the full extent of his love. Jesus said we should love like him. Therefore its truth can be seen in his disciples as we obey it. That the command is true doesn’t mean that it is merely right. It means that it is something that the disciples should practice and prove its truth. This truth was very different to the theoretical teaching of the Gnostics. The new command to love as Jesus loved is not empty; it nourishes Christians and its fruit is seen in their lives.

Verse 9,10. “Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. If anyone claims to be in the light but hates a brother, either he is a liar or is deceived by himself.” One who hates his brother has many things to make himself and others stumble. Hatred can be active through resentment, bitterness, jealousy but it can also be expressed passively through disinterest, simply an absence of love and concern for others. Either way, such lack of love hurts both the person and those he hates. Verse 11 says, “But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him.” The darkness of hatred blinds and causes us to stumble, it damages both our fellowship with one another and our fellowship with God. But if one loves his brother, he lives in the light. 

Fourth, fellowship though spiritual maturity

Verses 12-13 talk about three kinds of Christians. Verse 12 addresses, “dear children’, verse 13, ‘fathers’ and ‘young men’. Look at verse 12. “I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.” They are called as dear children because their sins were forgiven in the name of Jesus. They were born again by faith in Jesus yet are like children who need the protection of their parents. They can refer to young believers. They can grow with the conviction and faith of Jesus’ forgiveness. 

Verse 13a. “I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning.” Here ‘know’ means ‘experience’. Knowing can have many levels of depth. We can say we know someone even though we just know his name. Here ‘you know him’ means that they know God in depth with knowledge and experience. That they know him who is from the beginning means that their faith in based on faith in the Creator God. At that time the Gnostics denied that the Creator God had come as Jesus incarnate. But the spiritual ‘fathers’ among the believers knew God as if they had heard, seen and touched him. Their knowledge of God was a real and living fellowship. They had learnt of the wisdom of the Creator God and had matured through many spiritual experiences. They had a father’s heart for the spiritually young and nothing could shake their faith. 

Verse 13b. “I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.” Children can refer to those who have been born again recently. Young men suggests a growth in maturity to those who fight the good fight of faith in their practical lives and experience victory. Young men are by nature active and dynamic. They have power. Often it is the young who pioneer and expect and attempt great works of God. Jesus saves us from our sins and gives us power to fight and win the battle against the evil one. How can a young man overcome the evil one? Verse 14b. “I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.” It is through the living word of God in his heart. The word of God overcomes the evil one. It is the word of God alone that can defeat the evil one. God’s word is the sword of the Spirit. 

Among the three, ‘fathers’ are the most mature people of faith. Their characteristic is that they sacrifice and serve like fathers and mothers. They do not take it as a burden but rather rejoice in it. Why? It is because they have father’s and mother’s heart. Yet it’s no coincidence that John finishes with the picture of the young men with the word of God living in them winning the spiritual victory. For, it is through fighting our spiritual battles each day with God’s word in us that we grow from children into Fathers, enjoying deep fellowship with God. 

Fifth, Do not love the world 

Verse 15, “Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.” Whether we are a child, a young man or a father, in order to deepen and grow in our fellowship with God we should not love the world or anything in it. The word ‘world’ is repeated 6 times in verses 15-17. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father simply is not in him. If we love the world our love for God grows cold. The word ‘love’ in ‘Do not love the world’ is ‘agapeo’ in Greek. This is the same word used to describe the love of God. It means absolute love, giving the first priority of our heart. This idolatry, or spiritually speaking, adultery to God. How can my fellowship with God deepen when my heart loves something else? God sees everything, can you imagine how he feels, how hurt he is when he sees us lusting after the world instead of giving our hearts to him? 

Here the world refers to the powers of this dark world, and Satan. Verse 16. “For everything in the world— the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does— comes not from the Father but from the world.” The way to overcome love of the world is to see it for what it is:tempoaray and perishing and unworthy of our love.Verse 17. “The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives for ever.” Powers, riches, honour and popularity, all will pass away. The world and its glory is temporary. It’s all grass. Therefore it is so in vain to love them with our lives. Everything—however beautiful or ugly or noble or intelligent--will pass away and rot. “But the man who does God’s will lives forever.” We should not be fooled living for the present and deserting the eternal blessing and fellowship in God forever. 

Sixth, be alert to antichrists

In verses 18-23 John warns believers of the dangers of antichrists, who through their false teaching, come in between and ruin the faith of believers and their fellowship with the living God. John was living in the end of the first century A.D. He said it was already the last hour. The last hour is between Jesus’ ascension and his second coming. Jesus said that the clearest of the signs of the last hour is the appearing of the antichrist. Then, what is the antichrist? Verses 22-23. “Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist— he denies the Father and the Son. No-one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.” The antichrist is the liar. What is the lie? To deny that Jesus is the Christ; anyone or any teaching that denies the Son and the Father. Even today, many antichrists are working to deceive the believers with all kinds of theories and philosophies. Fundamentally they deny that Jesus is the Christ and they are liars.

John first warned against the teachings of the antichrist and now talks about what we should do. His main point is that we should remain in what we have heard from the beginning. Verse 24. “See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.”‘What you have heard from the beginning’ refers to the gospel. They have heard the gospel and received salvation and eternal life by the anointing of the Holy Spirit. This teaching should remain in them. They should not be deceived by the ‘new teachings’ of the antichrists but rather keep their first faith by holding on to the gospel truth.

We might nod in agreement when hearing this, but have we really taken to heart and experienced in our lives of faith what happens when God's word remains in us? First, what do we mean by Jesus' words remaining in us? Another translation is let the word abide, or perhaps closer ‘possess you’. There is an expression when someone visits our house that we say, "please make yourself at home." Of course we don't literally mean that. We mean “in the room we have shown you by all means feel comfortable.” But if someone started to rearrange my pictures or the way I stacked my books or have my music collection, I would begin to take offence. Likewise if they started making a meal in the kitchen, or lying down on my bed or having a bath, again I would be somewhat put out. But that is what John is saying when he is saying let the word remain in you. He is saying let the words of God take possession of your life.

It is a question, do we have that kind of fellowship with the word? Perhaps at different times of our life of faith we did have a very vital relationship to God's word. Perhaps when we first met Jesus, and first began to read his word and realised how relevant, how alive his words were to our own situation that we couldn't wait but wake up in the morning to read them. But perhaps now in our bible studies, in our testimony writing, in our general attitude to the word of God we no longer expect to be surprised, and we no longer really allow the word of God to take possession of us. We might go to favourite passages of the Bible and enjoy a comforting words, but we don't allow all Jesus's words into our lives. Or rather we just think about them theoretically and intellectually but we don't allow the words to change us in our behaviour and in our actions. As a result our relation to the word of God becomes superficial and it no longer excites us or surprises us or feeds us, and our fellowship with God also becomes superficial. Spiritually speaking, this is a dangerous moment and this is why people become vulnerable to false teaching, teaching of antichrists that set itself up as being more sophisticated than the gospel of Jesus.

John therefore challenges us to think again about the words that we have already received. He asks us to allow them to continue to change us as they once did. We why is it that young Christians at times seem to grow so much faster than believers who have known Jesus's words for many years. Simply speaking, it is because they allow the word to possess them. A life of faith is not determined by length of time, but whether we allow the words of Jesus to remain in us and control us and the extent to which we obey them..

What does John promise will happen if we allow the Word of God to possess us? He promises that the “Son and the Father will also remain in you.” This reminds us of John 14:21 "If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him". The results of this deep relationship to God's word is a deep fellowship with the Father and Jesus. When we have this fellowship we won't look for the teaching of antichrists which will so obviously be inferior. In verse 27 John refers to the anointing of the Holy Spirit which teaches us the truth about God's words. This does not mean we do not need human teachers, but only that the Holy Spirit is the one who convinces us in our heart what is true.

In conclusion I pray that whatever stage we are in our lives of faith whether we are children or young men or fathers, we may continue to deepen our fellowship with the father and his son by making sure that what we have heard from the beginning remains in us and takes possession of us.
