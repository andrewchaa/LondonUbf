1 John 4 
LET US LOVE ONE ANOTHER
1 John 4:1-21
Key verse 4:7
Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.

In today’s passage, Apostle John tells the Ephesians to test the spirits whether they are from God or not and teaches us how we can discern the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood. He also tells us to love one another. Love and truth always come together in the Bible they are inseparable, just as Jesus himself is both love and truth. This message is divided into two parts, first discerned the Spirit of truth and secondly love one another. May God give us his wisdom to discern the spirits and his love to love one another.
I. Discern the Spirit of truth 
Look at verse 1 “Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.” To be Christian means to put a greater emphasis on believing. The righteous will live by faith. We believe in God's word and the Gospel revealed to us through the Scriptures. At the same time because of our belief in the gospel there are many things we do not believe. Christian faith in that sense is not blind faith, it takes discernment to distinguish truth from falsehood. Here, John is saying that we should not believe every spirit but need to discern whether they are from God or not. Usually knowledge and teaching is presented to us through people, but John makes clear that behind people different spirits are at work. Paul says that discerning the spirit is a gift from God (1Co 12:10) and here John is saying that all Christians need to have this ability. Why is he saying this? It’s because there are so many false prophets in this world. False prophets may very obviously set themselves up against Christianity they are easy to discern as such whether as scientism, atheism or post-modernism or any number of secular philosophies. But then there are false prophets who were not so easy to identify, often masquerading as sincere Christian faith. Such ideas can come as liberalism or legalism, Satan always wants to pervert and distort the truth of God's word through false teaching. False prophets can mislead many - claiming that they have received some special insight from God. John wanted to help believers to avoid the deception, confusion, hurt and unbelief that such distorted teaching causes. 
Therefore, what is the most important, discerning criterion for the spirit? Look at verse 2 “This is how you can recognise the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,” It is whether the spirit denies Jesus coming into this world in the flesh or not. Jesus came in to this world as a human being. He is God almighty, yet he had a human form like us. Every spirit that acknowledges this truth is from God. And every spirit that does not acknowledge this truth is not from God. The word ‘acknowledge’ care is important, it can also be translated as ‘commitment to.’ Anybody can read out with their lips The Apostles Creed, that states that Jesus came in the flesh as the son of God, but what matters is that they acknowledge this in their lives through their commitment to Jesus Christ as the son of God.
Look at verse 3 “But every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.” The spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. They are false prophets who are under Satan. They not only deny Jesus’ coming into this world in the flesh but also they deny salvation through the cross of Jesus. Gnostics belonged to them. They thought the spirit is good and the body is evil. So, they argued that it is impossible for a good spirit to have an evil body. So, they denied Jesus who came with human flesh. They denied the essential truth of Christian doctrines. 
Look at verse 4 “You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.” John addresses the Ephesian believers has dear children, this expresses his love for them as their spiritual father, but it also implies the attitude we should have towards God and his word. Part of the reason for revisionist theology, and the amount of doubt that Christians are attacked with through supposedly intellectual arguments that question Scripture, is that those who promote such ideas have lost their identity as little children before God and his word. They place themselves and their own ideas and thinking as superior to the words that are revealed to us in the Scriptures through the Holy Spirit. We need to maintain a humble attitude before the word of God. 
John says "You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them." Here, “overcome” is written with present perfect. This has been already achieved and it affects the present right now. It it can seem at times these days that Christianity is on the back foot; that secular ideology is so powerful and that believers represent the weakest of minorities. We can wonder how we can be victorious, and overcome false prophets and teachers. But here John declares to us that God in us is greater than any other in this world. We belong to God by confessing Jesus as Christ and by doing so, we can overcome false teaching and become victorious. For that reason we shouldn't worry too much about the power of the world’s ideas. And, rather we should simply put our trust in the power of God's words and keep bringing God's words to this generation.
Look at verse 5 “They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them.” People who belong to this world are godless, they are hostile to God and his word. They talk about the wisdom and experience of this world and people listen to them. Often worldly ideas are very popular, and feature in mainstream radio and television programmes. The world has an itching ear for any idea that sets itself up against the gospel. One can wonder why it is that people take so seriously some liberal intellectual sitting at a desk in a university somewhere as being more authoritative than the eyewitnesses of Jesus. 
But, who do people of God listen to? Look at verse 6. “We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognise the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood.” When John says "We are from God," he is talking about the Apostles through whom the gospel was written down. People who are from God listen to the teaching of the apostles who have been taught by Jesus’ teaching. They listen to the words of truth, the words of God.  However, those who belong to the false teaching, do not listen to the apostles or the word of God. Even if they are clever, they can be misled. 2 Corinthians 4:3-4 says, “And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.”
What should we do then practically so that we may not be misled by false spirits? First of all, we need to love the word of God and know it correctly. Second, we need the identity as “little children” before the word of God, with a humble attitude. We also need to give up any excessive/unnecessary curiosity. If we are eager to have some mystic experience, we can become vulnerable to devil’s schemes. 
II. Love one another
Look at verse 7. “Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God.” “Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.” Why should Christians love one another? We can perhaps begin to answer that question by thinking who is another? What does ‘another’ mean? Another means another person like myself. Often a lack of love stems from self-centredness. Of course there is active hatred and resentment but more often people just don't think about the other because we are so busy thinking about ourselves. My father once gave me a definition of a bore as "someone who is talking about himself one I want to talk about myself!" We might laugh at this, but our sinful nature essentially turns inward, making our favourite subject ourselves. Naturally we are sensitive to how we feel, what we want, how we can be happy and fulfilled whether materially or physically or emotionally. What John is saying is as believers born of God, we know God and share God's heart for others. That we realise they, like ourselves, have the same hopes, the same fears, the same insecurities, worries, doubts, problems and frustrations. Because they are ‘another’, they are equally valuable, equally precious in God's eyes. 

This sounds great, but it isn't so easy to love another. One of our main prayer topics for this ministry is to be a loving spiritual community. We are born of God and each one of us has a desire to love one. I'm sure that if I ask anybody in this room do you want to love your neighbour you want to love one another the answer will be "yes". John is saying in verse eight if that isn't the case perhaps they don't know God. But I believe each one of us wants to love one another in our hearts. The reality however, is that we are living in London, each of us struggle with our job, which can be highly competitive pressurised. Paul at the moment is struggling to make the billing for the end of the financial year, as a partner there is much at stake as he has to lead by example. Darren moves from one fashion show deadline to the next, June is about to have a baby that even yesterday she was writing to publishers and asking for references. Many of us have financial pressures and responsibilities, how to make the mortgages, and if it's not financial, its family, how to serve our kids and raise them in a way that they grow up to know Jesus, and that they are happy and fulfilled and live lives that any parent would want their children. These are all the reality is that we face each day, they are the realities of the lay mission in life. Yet all these realities can be burdens that make us self-centred, that overwhelm us with worries and anxieties that means that we have little room in our hearts for others.
It makes loving one another, holding the other in our minds and hearts, in practice difficult. It becomes even more difficult if the person we are called to love is difficult to love; if we find them selfish or insensitive or demanding or unthankful or simply draining. How can we love one another? If we look at verse seven again, "for love comes from God." The simple reality is we cannot love one another. In our own strength it is impossible, but John tells us love comes from God. What is this love that he's talking about and how can we tap into it? The answer is we have already received it. Look at verse 9, 10. “This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.” These words might be familiar to many of us. They are the gospel. And let's think on them one more time. We find it difficult when we are called to love when we have little room in our hearts. We find it difficult to love those we find hard to love. Our natural responses to shut them out or avoid them, or even worse response unlovingly towards them. In Christian communities resentment and bitterness can build up over years, in such a way that loving one another turns into indifference and then active ill will. I believe we have a loving community here! But for the reasons I have just mentioned we can be tempted into indifference, and might even be vulnerable to resentment. This is where the cross comes in. How did God respond to all the vileness the repetitive rebellion and rejection, instead of becoming enraged or resentful or simply indifferent, he responded in the most costly way, he sent his only son to die for us on the cross. When we find ourselves tempted to be unloving, when we find we are empty and have no room to love, when we find ourselves on the verge of indifference, it is the moment to come back to the cross remember again how much God has loved us and that same love is alive in our hearts. "We love, because he first loved us." (19) Love is in response to being loved. 
Verse 12 says "No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us." This is mysterious, that God is living in us and that his love is made complete in us when we love one another. God's love grows in our hearts as we come to him, as we pray Lord I am empty, I've reached my limit, please give me the love, the compassion, the concern for the other because I can't myself. This is not something to beat ourselves up about, it can take time, growing in God's life doesn't happen overnight. Rather this is how we grow day by day coming to God in prayer. It is a way that prayer to be a loving spiritual community is realised on a personal level. It may be that praying to love one another God gives us the heart to do one small specific thing. We might not be able to love everyone all at once. It might be one person who pops into my head, and we can think I can give that person a gift, I can visit their person and pray with them, I can give a person a call and ask how are they doing. I say this with great awareness that the focus of our ministry is in bringing the gospel to students. This should remain our focus, but loving one another as a community is also a very important part of bringing the gospel to students. Perhaps in the past we have neglected it, or rather we haven't developed the loving community in all its possibility. 
One of the wonderful things about our ministry is we all live quite close to one another. We have the Salisbury walk /Stoneleigh Terrace axis, then we have all those south of St John's Way. The great British institution is the cup of tea, it works like this, if one goes round to another person's house knocks on the door and says “give us a cup of tea!” That is the beginning of a conversation that can lead to a deeper friendship, a deeper understanding, a deeper carrying one another in prayer. It is something I would like to very much encourage as part of our ministry to raise up disciples of Jesus amongst university students.
I'm going to leave it there, there is far more to be said on this chapter, and I want to say that I've been convicted by how truth and love have to go together. It is no accident that John talks about testing the spirits and loving one another in such proximity. I can be someone who pushes  with truth and doesn't listen. Particularly when life is busy and my ability to listen to people severely reduces. Teaching the Bible and being doctrinally sound is absolutely essential but so too is loving one another. I pray that we may serve this generation with the truth and love of Jesus.
