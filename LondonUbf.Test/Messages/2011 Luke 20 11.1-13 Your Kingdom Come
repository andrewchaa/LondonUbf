YOUR KINGDOM COME

Luke 11:1-13
Key verse 11:2
�He said to them, When you pray, say: 'Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.�


Prayer is communication with God. In this passage Jesus teaches us how to communicate with God. In particular he teaches us two things; what to include in our prayers and the correct attitude in prayer. God wants a father / child relationship with us and that he wants us to pray boldly for his glory, that his kingdom would come and for our needs. And when we bring all of these things together we learn that our prayer lives should be dynamic, powerful and refreshing. We should have prayer lives which reflect what God wants and have confidence that he will answer. I pray that through today�s message we refresh our prayer lives and build a deeper relationship with our father God.

How to pray

Look at verse 1. �One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, �Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.� The disciples had been with Jesus for more than two years. They had faced some difficulties; the storm on the lake, the demon possessed boy who they could not heal, the many battles with the Pharisees and above all Jesus� explanation that he would have to die and they would have to take up their crosses. Through all of this the disciples must have noticed that Jesus was always calm, confident, loving, powerful and always knew God�s will. Even when they were fearful, Jesus was fine. The secret of this is in verse 1 which says, �One day Jesus was praying in a certain place.� Prayer was Jesus� habit, he did it every day. He prayed in the early morning, he prayed and fasted for 40 days fasting in the desert, he prayed all night before he appointed the apostles, he prayed on the mountain when he was transfigured and on this particular day he was praying as usual. Jesus always prayed, the disciples did not know how to pray so they asked Jesus; �teach us to pray as John taught his disciples.� 

The disciples had asked the right question. They knew that other rabbis and teachers taught their disciples to pray so they expected something like what John had taught his disciples. We don�t know what John taught his disciples but we know the Pharisees taught formal and ritualistic prayers. Jesus said; ��do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men� (Matt 6:4-6). Jesus� prayer was very different, he prayed with humility, strength, sincerity and passion. Jesus� prayer was communication between Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit, this was truly powerful prayer. Jesus wanted his disciples and wants us to learn to pray well so that we can powerfully communicate with God. So Jesus taught the disciples two things; how we should pray and the attitude we should have in coming to prayer. Like the disciples we need to rely on God in our daily lives therefore we also need to learn to pray and grow in our prayer so that we grow closer to God. 

Look at verse 2; �He said to them, �When you pray, say: 'Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.� There are two principles Jesus teaches us at the beginning of this prayer; who God is and what God wants. 

First he taught them who God is. When the disciples asked Jesus to teach them to pray like John this was not what they expected. Father is translated from the word Abba which literally means daddy. The Jews did not even dare use the word God but addressed him as Adonai, my Lord instead. Yet here Jesus uses the word daddy because this is the kind of relationship God wants with his children. John 1:12 says, �Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.� We are God�s children and he wants us to know him as our dad. Recently Helen has started to call Fran Amma, mummy and yesterday I heard her saying, da-da-da-da. I cannot wait for the day that she calls me daddy because she is my daughter and I love her and I want her to love me. This is the kind of relationship God wants with us, his children. If Helen called me dearest father it would be strange and cold. God does not want us to address him in this cold and distant way, instead he wants us to be close to him like a small child to their dad. Little children don�t hesitate to ask their parents for anything because they know their parents love them and will give them what they need. Likewise we should approach God in the spirit of little children, knowing that he loves us and wants to answer all our prayers.

At times we all struggle to come to God because we have a sense of self-condemnation. We think we can�t come because of what we have done. But our Father in heaven accepts us whenever we come to him calling, �Father�. He accepts us as we are with love, mercy and compassion. So let�s come to him with faith and confidence and ask for all things in prayer by faith. 
The next thing Jesus says we should say to God is; �Hallowed be your name�. God is our daddy but he is also Almighty God and the creator of the universe, we should also have holy fear of him. This means putting God is the right place in our lives. We should honour, worship and glorify the name of God because he is God. Deuteronomy 5:11 says; �You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.� We must remember in our prayer that we are addressing the holy God and glorify his name. Human nature is to seek our own glory. But as Christians glorifying God is the purpose of our lives. As God�s children our first desire should be to have God�s name worshipped, glorified and praised. As we grow in faith, more and more we should desire to see the name of God glorified in our prayer and in our lives.
Next Jesus says we should pray, �your kingdom come.� God�s kingdom is the place where God rules. If we have confessed Jesus as our Lord and Saviour then God is the ruler of our hearts and his kingdom has come in us. God�s kingdom is characterised by forgiveness, joy, hope, love, peace and new life. The world is filled with fear, hatred, suffering, sin and death. This is not how God created it instead he wants his kingdom to come into the heart of every person so that they may be set free from their suffering. If this is what God most wants for his creation then our prayer and our hearts desire should also be that God�s kingdom would come in the hearts of people. All of us can remember how we suffered before God�s kingdom came in our hearts and how we suffer when we don�t hold God�s kingdom in our hearts. This is how other people are suffering every day. If we have compassion on those people then we will want them to receive God�s kingdom too therefore we pray; �your kingdom come.� 

Look at verse 3; �Give us each day our daily bread.� Now Jesus teaches us to pray for ourselves. First he tells us to ask God for our daily bread. When the Israelites were in the desert God gave them their physical daily bread from heaven in the form of manna and he guided them spiritually with cloud and fire. After 40 years they were clear that they relied on God absolutely. Our lives are very different. If we are hungry we open the fridge or we go to the supermarket. We buy food with the money we earned and we are tempted to think that we supply our own needs. Yet self reliance leads to fear, worry, stress and greed because we know that we are not powerful enough to definitely supply our own daily bread. But God is almighty and our Father who wants to give us good things so we need to rely on God for our spiritual and physical daily bread. God wants us to come to him like little children and ask, daddy please give me breakfast, please give me advice, encouragement or even discipline and God will answer this prayer because he is our loving father. 

Look at verse 4; �Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.' When we come to faith in Jesus we are forgiven all our sin but our battle against sin continues. Each day we fail to seek God�s glory and God�s kingdom. This is sin and sin is separation from God so God is hurt because he wants us to be close to him like his little children. Repentance is the way in which we can come back to our father God. 1John 1:9 says, �If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.� We know how sinful we are therefore this is amazing grace. Just as we have received this grace God also wants us to pass it on to others. Therefore Jesus tells us to pray that; ��we also forgive everyone who sins against us.� 

To say; ��we also forgive�, assumes that we will forgive. We may not want to forgive others for their sins against us because we feel wounded by them. But it is a blessing to be able to forgive because forgiveness ends bitterness in our hearts and mends relationships with other people. Forgiveness is a godly act therefore when we forgive we do for others what God has done for us and we become more like God. When we forgive one another God�s name is glorified, God�s kingdom comes and we grow as a loving spiritual community. 

Finally Jesus teaches us to pray; �Lead us not into temptation.� Temptation does not come from God but Satan. Peter (1 Pe 5:8) says, �Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.� Therefore Jesus wants us to ask God to protect us from Satan�s temptation. Sin is separation from God and Satan wants to separate us from our loving father. Therefore we should really fear the sin which separates us from God. Every day we are tempted by images, feelings of anger or resentment to other people, our greed or worldly desires. Alone we cannot overcome temptation, we may want to but this is not enough. Paul says; �I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do� (Ro 7:15). Instead we need to overcome that temptation with something stronger. Again if we are maintaining our relationship with our loving father, if God�s kingdom is coming in then the space where the temptation is filled with God and with God�s love and the temptation is overcome. 
Jesus does not teach us formulas, he does not tell us to stand up or sit down or that we should prayer at a particular time of the day. Instead he tells us that God wants a father � child relationship with us through prayer. Our challenge therefore is to consider the state of our prayer lives. Is our prayer simply a list we repeat each day in a habitual manner or are we really communicating with God? Is our prayer a lively relationship with our loving God? Do we take time to pray? Do we really consider what God wants us to pray for? Do we really enjoy our time with our loving father? This is what really strikes me in this passage, that God really wants us to enjoy our relationship with him. So I pray that each one of us would think again about our prayer, about how we pray and about whether or not we really enjoy our time with our father God.
Our attitude to prayer
After teaching the disciples how to pray Jesus told them a story to teach them the correct attitude to prayer. Look at verses 5-8; �Then he said to them, Suppose one of you has a friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.' Then the one inside answers, 'Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.' I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man's boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.�
In the story a traveller has arrived in a friend�s village late at night. The rules of hospitality dictated that the owner of the house must serve his friend but he had no food so he went to his neighbour to ask. The neighbour was not happy when the man banged on his door in the middle of the night. We can understand why. He is asleep, the neighbour is waking up his wife and his children, to do so is bad manners and it is all to feed a man he has never even met before. Yet he gets up because of the persistence of the man knocking on his door. 
This story does not teach us that God is like a miserable neighbour who only does things grudgingly. Instead what it teaches us is that we really need to battle in our prayers to bring our petitions and requests to God. The man in the story does not go to his neighbour for himself but on behalf of his friend. Therefore the first thing we can learn about our attitude to prayer is that we need to come in prayer not only for our own needs but the needs of others. In particular we need to come to God with his heart and pray for what God wants, that his name be glorified and his kingdom come. When we persistently pray in this way we grow to share in God�s heart. Then we are coming to God and asking him to do the things we know he wants to see done in this world. 
For us this means praying for people to study the Bible. We pray for God�s kingdom to come to university students through one to one Bible study. This is a good prayer in itself. Each one of us can pray, persistently to God that he would send us one student who we can serve and raise as a disciple of Jesus� Christ. But it means that all our other prayers should also be focused on God�s kingdom too. If we think about what we generally pray for it will include jobs, money, houses, relationships, studies and children. It is good to pray for each of these things, Jesus tells us; �If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer� (Matt 21:22). What this means is that we can pray for anything we choose. But each of these prayers can be made into a prayer for God�s name to be glorified and God�s kingdom to come. When we pray for our children to be healthy and strong and do well at school it can be a prayer that they would know God personally and his kingdom would come in their hearts and that they would become powerful witnesses to the love of God in their generation. When we pray for our work it can be that this would support us financially to do God�s work on the campus and that we can preach the gospel to our colleagues. We can pray for our marriages to be used to create an environment to serve and for our studies to create opportunities to meet and understand university students. All our prayers can be that God�s kingdom comes so that we have the same desires as our father God and we are praying into his desires.  
The second thing we learn here about attitude is that we should be bold. The man did not get up because his neighbour was his friend but because he kept on knocking. Verse 9 says we should ask, seek and knock. This is very active, persistent language. Therefore we should bring our prayers to God with persistence and keep on praying them until they are answered. How will God answer? God only has three answers to our prayers; yes, no or later and like a good parent he will give us what is best for us. 
We may wonder if it is right to pray for a particular thing. Verses 11 to 13 tell us that we should not be afraid to come to God with any prayer. Jesus tells us that God will not give us a snake if we ask for a fish or a scorpion if we ask for an egg. God, our loving father, does not give us bad things. Therefore we should not be afraid to ask for anything and know that the worst thing which can happen is that God will say no and even then this is because he loves us and knows what is best for us.
In fact God wants to give us something even better than the things we ask for, he wants us to have the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is our source of power, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. If we ask God to give us the Holy Spirit we will receive this, we will grow in our love for God, his name is glorified and his kingdom will come and we will be satisfied in him. 
In conclusion. God loves us as his children and he wants a loving relationship with us through prayer. God wants his name to be glorified, his kingdom to come and to meet all our needs. All of this happens when we pray. So let�s come confidently to God in our daily prayer, ask him for our needs and pray that his kingdom would come in our lives.
