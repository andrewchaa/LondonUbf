2011 Luke 32

JESUS CAME TO SAVE THE LOST

Luke 19:1-10
Key verse 19:10 
"For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.�  
 
In today�s passage we see the love and mercy of God in Jesus who came to save the lost. Lost people, by definition, can�t find the way by themselves. They need seeking and saving. They need Jesus as their shepherd. I pray we may learn Jesus� love and mercy on one person whom he sought out and saved. This message is divided into three parts: The Lost Zacchaeus, Jesus� Seeking and Jesus� Saving.

I. Zacchaeus, one lost man (1-4) 

Look at verse 1. �Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.� Jericho is 15 miles northeast of Jerusalem, near the Jordan river. It is thought to be the oldest city in the world and was the first city the Israelites conquered after 40 years of their desert wandering. It was a beautiful city covered with Palm trees, so it was known as the city of Palms. It was also on the trade routes of Asia Minor and to the East as well as Jerusalem to the south, so it was a key city for collecting tax. Jesus was passing through this city, he was on his way to Jerusalem, but he still had one more person that he very much wanted to meet.

Look at verse 2. �There was a man by the name of Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and wealthy.� We don�t know much about this man Zacchaeus, or about his back story, but this verse tells us three things, his name, his job and that he was wealthy. The name Zacchaeus means �purity� or �righteousness�. We are given names by our parents. Often the name reveals a parent�s hope for their child. Particularly in Hebraic culture, the name referred very much to the character of the person. So maybe growing up Zacchaeus� mum often taught him about the importance of purity and righteousness in an unbelieving generation. Maybe Zacchaeus initially shared his parent�s hopes for him, and struggled to live as the Bible had taught him but somewhere along the way, whether it was adolescent rebellion, or the poverty of his household, or some other experience, Zacchaeus� life took a very different turn. We know because of his job. There is a massive disparity between the name Zacchaeus and his profession as chief tax collector, to the point that it�s deeply funny. Jericho had a chief tax collector called purity and righteousness! People must have greeted him on the street, �Afternoon Mr Purity and Righteousness,� with a snigger of irony. 

We know already how deeply unpopular tax collectors were from Levi who was one of Jesus� disciples. They were considered traitors, collaborators with the Romans, ready to sell out their own people, extorting money for their own dishonest gain. Zacchaeus wasn�t just a tax collector, he was a chief tax collector, which meant he wasn�t personally in a tax booth on street corners like Levi, he had many junior tax collectors under him who he oversaw. He was who Levi perhaps would have become say, in 20 years time if he had not met Jesus. To get to his position he had to be better, and sharper than all the other tax collectors, he must have been that much more unscrupulous, devious and brilliant than the others, the king pin, the mafia boss etc. To get to the top of his profession he would have had to be very determined. It is interesting that Luke points out that he was a short guy, perhaps the experience of being short made him that much more determined than others. 

How does a person get lost? How does a person get into a position like Zacchaeus, who makes the journey from the small boy with a mother�s hope of purity and righteousness to the most despised of professions? We can be tempted to construct any number of potential traumatic experiences, or stories of poverty to account for his journey. It might just be that he was simply good at it his job and enjoyed the satisfaction of making a profit and �getting one over� on his neighbour. Yet we know from verse 1 is that he was wealthy, and let�s be clear, money was really the only reason why you would become a tax collector. In that sense, his wealth was a different kind of wealth from the rich ruler we learned about last week. Whereas that guy had most probably inherited his money, Zacchaeus� money was self-made. He had had to work for every penny, and he had got his hands dirty making that money. In this life people can get rich doing �noble� work like the lady who started the Body Shop company or green technologies, and there are other professions that are known to be dirty, like pornographers, or tabloid journalists etc. which people can feel united in their condemnation. We see later all the people were united in condemning Zacchaeus. But Zacchaeus had at some point decided money was worth, the unpopularity, the scorn and hatred others. Why? Because money isn�t just about money, it�s about the luxury, the privilege and the power that it brings with it. May be he saw money and power being an answer to being a short guy. People in the past might have laughed at him for being short, and he had been determined to show them. Now as chief tax collector they might have despised him but he was powerful and rich and could make their lives difficult, may be they feared him.

Yet we also see that whatever he gained with his money, it didn�t make him happy, because it had come at a terrible cost. What was that cost? He simply he was lost. He had lost his purity and righteousness and he knew it. He had lost his inner respect and love for himself and he knew he was far from God. He had found out too late that happiness and peace don�t come from money but from knowing the love of God, and also the love and respect of people. He had lost both. He had lost any sense of life�s deeper meaning or God�s hope or vision or purpose. In the past perhaps he hadn�t valued either God or people. He was young and ambitious and wanted things, but now he had begun to realise and deeply regretted his choices. We might see Zacchaeus as a rather unique or distant figure. However, last week�s riots and looting has shown us that we are a society of Zacchaeuses, people who think getting stuff, whatever the cost to themselves or their community will make them happy. It is shocking to see that level of lostness on a national level. It took the police and politicians by surprise, people don�t know how to respond, they respond with moral outrage and condemnation, they say society is sick. But really this is an expression of the deep loss of God in people�s lives, expressed through rampant materialism, greed and lawlessness. Simply without Jesus people get lost.

II Jesus came to seek  

In this passage there are two people seeking. Zacchaeus is seeking Jesus, and more profoundly Jesus is seeking Zacchaeus. But first let�s think about Zachaeus. Zacchaeus heard that Jesus was passing by Jericho and didn�t want to miss his chance. Look at verse 3. �He wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not, because of the crowd.� Here �wanted� is more like �had wanted� in the original Greek. This implies he had been wanting to meet him for some time. It shows that he had spiritual desire. He might have heard that Jesus had forgiven Levi the tax collector and had made him his disciple and that he ate with the sinners and the tax collectors like him. When he heard about Jesus he came to have hope for himself. He wanted to meet this person. News of Jesus always gives hope to people living in despair. It plants the desire to turn back from a sinful life and live a new life. 

Yet Zacchaeus had to overcome a few obstacles in order to meet Jesus. Look at verse 4, �So he ran ahead of and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.� Jesus was surrounded by many people. He had to get through the crowd but no one was going to help him. He was short. He couldn�t see Jesus behind the crowd even if he jumped. Yet what�s great is he didn�t give up. He somehow found a way to see Jesus by running ahead and climbing a sycamore tree. It must have been quite a sight, this short middle aged man. Yet from him, we learn the secret of coming to Jesus. 

Which was his spiritual desire. Zacchaeus is a great example to many of us because he isn�t any longer in his youth. Often it�s the young who have zeal and passion and the desire to change things and learn and grow, hence the importance and potential of a student ministry. Yet Zacchaeus isn�t a student yet he has more passion, more willingness, courage and hunger than the previous much younger rich ruler we learned about. That tells me, there is no reason to stop seeking God, no reason to become complacently middle aged in our attitude to Jesus. Zacchaeus reminds us of Paul, who even late in life confessed, �Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that which Christ Jesus took hold of me.�(Ph 3:12) No doubt Zacchaeus� waistline had expanded with all his rich food and short height. Yet he still ran, and he climbed. Men are usually very concerned about their dignity, but Zacchaeus didn�t care, he just wanted to meet Jesus. Deep down he wanted to meet God, he knew in his heart only God could satisfy him. 

We can also learn that he didn�t allow the crowd or his past sin or his short height or any other reason get in the way of him seeking Jesus. Just seeing a tree isn�t enough. He had to climb the tree. Zacchaeus didn�t blame others or his situation but climbed the tree. People like Zacchaeus can meet Jesus. God is found by those who seek him with all their hearts (Jer 29:13). Climbing up the tree means that we leave where we are and go forward to a higher place. While we stay in our current situation, Jesus would pass by. To meet Jesus, we should leave our current problems behind and go up the tree of the word of God, the tree of prayer and the tree of obedience. Even if we would face many difficulties, if we climb these trees with �somehow� spirit, Jesus will meet us and lead us to salvation.

So Zacchaeus was seeking Jesus, but more profoundly Jesus was seeking Zacchaeus. There is a Psalm where David confesses, �O LORD, you have searched me and you know me. You know when I sit and when I rise you perceive my thoughts from afar.� (Ps 139) Look at verse 5. �When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.� Jesus knew the heart of Zacchaeus, he knew where he was sitting, and he sought him out by name.

Jesus knew Zachaeus� name. He knew everything, he knew him personally. When people had called him by name it had been with sarcasm and irony. Yet when Jesus called Zacchaeus he was calling him back to God�s original intention and vision for his life. �Zacchaeus, I have hope for you to be restored, in purity and righteousness.� How touched Zacchaeus must have been, not to be insulted but in front of everyone, honoured with the hope and vision of God. Jesus wanted to awaken his spiritual desire deeply hidden in his heart and restore his original name.

Jesus not only called his name but he wanted to stay at his house. Jesus wanted to be friends with Zacchaeus and heal his broken life and help him to live a new life. People muttered and judged him as an untouchable sinner but Jesus had compassion on him. Jesus saw his inner suffering, sickness and guilt. He needed a shepherd�s help. He needed comfort and much encouragement. So Jesus stayed at his house and ate with him and listened to his long life story. Jesus is Holy Almighty God and Zacchaeus was an ugly sinner. This is God�s amazing grace   as Immanuel. Jesus never turns down anyone who seeks him. This Jesus wants to stay with us and eat and drink with us today. Rev 3:20 says, �Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me.� When we repent Jesus doesn�t mind our past but heal us completely in his grace.

Zacchaeus was so happy and moved and came down quickly. 

Look at verse 7. �All the people saw this and began to mutter, �He has gone to be the guest of a 'sinner'.� I am struck by the contrast between Jesus and the mutterers. To them, once a sinner, always a sinner, they didn�t know Jesus� heart towards the lost. It�s always easier to mutter about people than to eat with them. I pray we may be a community that eats with each other and loves one another and cuts out the muttering in our hearts.

III Jesus came to save

What happened to Zacchaeus� heart when he accepted Jesus? Look at verse 8. �Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.� 
What we see here is the complete transformation of the human heart. Often people want to see miracles, well here is a miracle! Zacchaeus is profoundly changed and becomes a new creation. Nothing visible has happened, but everything has changed .

First, his Lord is changed. Previously his Lord was money. He loved money and was enslaved by money, and he made everyone suffer because of money. When Jesus became Lord of his life, he was able to steward his money and have sympathy towards the poor. Before, he couldn�t imagine giving away half of his wealth to the poor. Yet when he came to serve Jesus as his Lord, he willingly gave away his wealth. Now Jesus was everything to him and he just wanted to please him. There is no hint of reluctance, in his giving, he is full of joy, true joy of the soul! This joy comes when we give up our idols and follow Jesus. What a contrast to the rich ruler who went away sad. No amount of will or self improvement can bring about this joy or inner change only God can when we get rid of our idols and embrace Jesus. 

Second, his value system was changed. His decision to give away half of his wealth and repay four times what he had stolen shows shows his spiritual desire to make restitution of his past sinful life and to live a righteous life serving God. He realised that despite his financial loss, serving God with his life was the most valuable thing. When he came to have a new value system, he willingly and voluntarily began to live a sacrificial and devoted life of faith. Even if we accept Jesus as our saviour, if our value system doesn�t change, our lives of faith will be full of conflicts between Jesus and the world. But if we have a clear order and value system about God, men and the world, we can live with a conviction regardless the changing circumstances. 

When Zacchaeus repented and decided to live a new life, Jesus proclaimed his salvation. Look at verse 9. �Jesus said to him, �Today salvation has come to this house, because, this man, too, is a son of Abraham.� �Today� shows that salvation is always in present tense. Jesus didn�t say that though Zacchaeus repented today, his salvation would be decided after seeing how he would do in the future. Jesus forgave all his sins and proclaimed his salvation the very moment he repented and accepted Jesus. Jesus called him a son of Abraham because he now came to enjoy all the grace and privileges. Abraham�s children are God�s children. Therefore they are the heirs of the kingdom of God. Until then, Zacchaeus had been excluded from the privilege of the children of Abraham because he left God. But since he accepted Jesus by faith, he became a legitimate son of Abraham and an heir of the kingdom of God. Also through him, his whole household came to have access to salvation. Zacchaeus� change showed that any sinner could be changed and be saved when they accept God�s invitation by faith. 

Look at verse 10. �For the Son of Man came to seek and save what was lost.� Zacchaeus was lost and Jesus was the Messiah who came to seek and save him.  To the world�s eyes he didn�t seem to be lost, just sinful. In the world�s eyes he could seem to be quite successful. But his spiritual reality was that he had lost everything. Zacchaeus earned all he wanted but lost God. When he lost God, he lost the image of God in him, God�s purpose in his life, the meaning of his life and people�s trust and love. He lost all that mattered. He was a loser who was heading towards judgement. We don�t regard those who are educated well and have certain statuses in the society as losers. We think they are the winners. But biblically those who have left God are losers. They are the lost. They look they live their lives freely and happily in this world but inwardly they are wandering miserably like Cain. Their hearts are full of meaninglessness, disappointment and fear of judgement. They are sick of the disease that leads to death. Jesus sees all those who have left God as the lost. 

A parent can�t do anything until s/he finds the child who is lost. They seek until they find. Jesus came to Jericho to seek and save Zacchaeus the lost man on his way to Jerusalem to fulfil his redemption for the world. Jesus deserted the glory of heaven and came to this world to save the lost. Jesus came to seek the lost on his initiative. He paid the price for their sin himself and opened the way of salvation. 

If Jesus didn�t seek us, no one knows where and how miserably we would have been living. But by Jesus� great one-sided grace and love, we were saved and became Abraham�s children. Great Christians are those who remember this great grace and lived a life of debtors throughout their lives. John Newton was one of the lost but Jesus sought him and save him. He came to live a new life. He was full of praise all the time because of this great and amazing grace of salvation. �Amazing grace! how sweet the sound! That saved a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now am found; Was blind, but now see.� He devoted his life to seek the lost like him in response to this amazing grace. We are all debtors to Jesus� love. We can only respond by seeking the lost children of God. 

In conclusion, many students are wandering in sin without God like Zacchaeus. They are very able. But when they live their lives only for themselves without God, they cannot but suffer death out of loneliness and guilt. They need a shepherd who can seek them and lead them to salvation. May God give us Jesus� heart of seeking for them.
