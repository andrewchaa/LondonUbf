2011 Luke 9                                                                                         

HEAR THE WORDS AND PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE

Luke 6:20-49
Key verse 6:47,48
	�I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and 	puts them into practice. He is like a man building a house, who dug down 	deep and laid the foundation on rock. When the flood came, the torrent 	struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.�

Last week we saw that in the face of the spiritual corruption and legalism of the Scribes and Pharisees, Jesus called the twelve apostles. When we get to the kingdom of heaven the names of the 12 apostles will be written on the foundation of the city (Rev 21:4). Jesus says the apostles will judge the twelve tribes of Israel (Lk 22:30). In calling 12 Jesus was starting a new Israel and spiritual order. So what would these men be like? If the teachers of the law and Pharisees are not what Jesus was looking for then what does he hope for? What standard should these men live by? Luke tells us in the sermon on the plain. Some spend months going through this but today we want to take the sermon as a whole. There are 3 elements I want to think about: real blessing; real character and real obedience.

I. Real blessing (20-26)

First who are blessed? Jesus teaches what kind of life is blessed and what kind of life results in woes. Look at verses 20-22: �Looking at his disciples, he said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.� Jesus went down with those he chose and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there. These were the ones who had recently decided to follow Jesus. Some had these strange new titles of apostles. Perhaps they anticipated becoming high flying officials as �leaders� and �missionaries� for Jesus� new kingdom.  Yet Jesus looking at his disciples gives this incredible teaching. �Blessed are you who are poor, hungry, those who weep and those who are hated.� Now this sounds crazy. Since when did poverty, hunger, sorrow and rejection become blessing?  This was not what they were expecting! Now of course most of us here in church have read this before and we know the �right� answer. We say �of course Jesus is speaking spiritually� and �we are to have a different value system to the world� and so on. But our lives tell a very different story � outside here you would never say these things are blessings. Outside here we usually work hard for money, we work hard for food, we work hard and struggle for recognition, acceptance and for a good life and when we get it we are happy and when we don�t we are down or upset or jealous of others. 

Jesus also pronounced curses for his young disciples. What are they? Look at verses 24-26: �But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort. Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep. Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false prophets.� These are sobering warnings for Christians in the developed countries of the world. It is a hard warning to swallow. Even as believers we want to be rich, well fed, happy and so on. 

So what is Jesus saying? Jesus� words were paradoxical. Jesus is making a mockery of all the world values and considers a blessing and mocking all that the world considers woes.  We all know poverty, hunger, weeping, persecution and friendlessness are not what we want for our life or the lives of our children.  And we don�t think of a full stomach, laughter, deep and rich friendships and lack of persecution are terrible things. No. Jesus is being deliberately provocative and ironic. That is obvious, but the question is, �Why?�  Why is Jesus talking about blessing and woe in this way?

Because as disciples it is easy for us to miss the point. Jesus is pointing out that neither wealth nor poverty, in and of itself, is a blessed state. Whether we are blessed or cursed depends on something else. The key to the beatitudes is to see the words at the end of verse 22: �because of the son of man�. Whether poverty or wealth are a blessing or curse depends solely on our relationship to the Son of Man, Jesus. Blessed are you who are poor, blessed are you who hunger now, blessed are you who weep now � why? Because Jesus is the treasure!  Jesus is telling us that he is our joy and satisfaction!  If we have Jesus our joy will not be taken even if poor, or hungry, or weeping, friendless or persecuted. Conversely he warns �woe to you who are rich�, �woe to you who are well fed now�. When rich or well fed an attitude of self-satisfaction creeps in. Worldly wealth can make us complacent, as though the wealth we have is the reward for which we have laboured in Jesus. It is therefore a deception for us and to this Jesus says woe. 

This is hugely challenging and a radically different value system to the world. And notice that Jesus is saying this to his disciples (20).  This is not just something for unbelievers. We all have heard stories of rich people that had miserable lives.  Darren was reminding me of Kurt Cobain and his tragic death � wealthy, famous, respected musician yet he blew his head off with a shotgun. Princess Diana is another tragic life that comes to mind despite having so much. These are people who had what the world offers yet realising its emptiness. But Jesus is saying this to his disciples. He�s saying this to you and me. Because we can get confused about this.  We can be so grieved and frustrated by what we lack: �Lord, I just need my job sorting out. Lord I just want my children to love you.  Lord, I want my wife to love me; I want my husband to love me.  Lord, I just want to provide for my family; I just need some fruit in my ministry.�  And on and on and on � the things that we lack and want can be good things but if they�re the first thing we�ve taken our eyes off the treasure and forgotten the true blessing. One of the old Puritans said that, �If Christ were not in heaven, I would not want to go there�. Why did he say that?  Because he understood that the greatest prize is Christ. Another Puritan, Thomas Watson said, "Things of this world will no more keep out trouble of spirit than a piece of paper will stop a bullet.  Worldly delights are winged, they may be compared to a flock of birds in the garden that stay a little while but when you come near to them they take their flight.� Blessing is not to do with what we physically have and in fact what we have can make us blind to what we really need. Blessing is knowing and treasuring Jesus. The real blessing is Jesus. 

II. Real character (27-38)

Second Jesus� teaches us about the extraordinary character that Jesus� disciples should have and the fundamental commands they must obey. What are they? Look at verses 27-30: �But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.� Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you. Bless when cursed. Ouch! It is possible to interpret Jesus� blessings and curses poetically and figuratively. But it is not possible to misinterpret what Jesus is saying here. And yet Christians have tried. Even Martin Luther said that Jesus can�t have been serious in giving these commands, and suggested that they only relevant in Christian fellowship and in the kingdom of God. We should not be like Luther on this. Who are your enemies? Don�t let this live in a theoretical philosophical world where we say �that�s nice. Love your enemies. Yes I know other people who really need to do that�. Right now in your mind, see the face of your enemy, the person who has done you harm, the most damage, the most injustice and caused you grief, stress and anguish. Who do you have in mind right now? Jesus says love them. Love that person. 

Jesus explains himself very clearly in verse 31. �Do to others as you would have them do to you.� In this verse, Jesus declares that his disciples must have a proactive faith. We must �do�. That is, we are expected to act as Christians and sons of the Most High by (to borrow the observation of Gandhi) �becoming the change we seek.� We are not to wait for the world to change before we start acting on our faith. People like to wait for others to change or the situation to be different before we do something: �when my job settles down; when I get more time; when I have some money; when the children are older�. But we are called to love now, to do good now. We are called to give as an act of faith that might bear the fruit of love and good in this dark world. This is the central message of Jesus� cross:  that God so loves the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life. 

Our standard is the love of God shown in Jesus Christ. What does this look like? Look at verses 35-38. �But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven�.� Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you. Do not judge. Do not condemn. Forgive. Love your enemies. There is a lot we could say about this but the one thing is that on reading this we realize how far short we fall. In the face of these commands, everyone finds that they are sinners. They are impossible to obey in our own strength. We cannot do these naturally. And here we come to the heart of the problem. Jesus knows this and knows we must be radically changed. In fact so much so we must become new. How new should we be? Look at verses 43-45: �No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thorn bushes, or grapes from briers. The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.� Very simple � you don�t get figs from thorn bushes. If you do bad things it�s because you are bad. Deep down there is a cultural idea that we are good people but sometimes we do bad things. At UCL yesterday I met a guy who when he was 17 attended an Alpha course. He says he enjoyed it and liked the people who ran it but he rejected Jesus. He said the reason was because �basically in everyone there is good. Deep down in us there is purity and goodness�. But Jesus says no. A bad tree cannot bear good fruit. It�s no good a thorn bush saying �I know they don�t look like figs but if I try hard enough they will be�. In short Jesus is saying we don�t need improved hearts in order to be good we need entirely new ones. We need regeneration. God does not want us to do better, try harder, be nicer � rather we have to be uprooted and replanted and given an entirely new root if we want to bear good fruit. After having a new root we then can slowly start to bear good fruit by storing up good. 

III. Real Obedience (46-49)

All of this sounds wonderful. How can a disciple live this radically different life? Jesus says it depends on foundation. In short Jesus� disciples live their lives on his word. Look at verses 46-48: �Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say? I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice. He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.� 


First �why do you me Lord, Lord and do not do what I say?�  This is a good question. Of course we should call Jesus �Lord, Lord�. In repeating it twice a person is saying that Jesus is not just teacher but the teacher of teachers, the master of all masters, the master teacher. And not only that that he is one who speaks for Jehovah. Someone who says this is showing incredible respect for Jesus. But Jesus says that �if this is all it�s not enough�. Admiring Jesus, liking Jesus, respecting Jesus is not enough. Although they call Jesus Lord, in reality they do not want to accept him as Lord and follow him. Though they call Jesus Lord, they follow their own wisdom, worldly desire and selfish dream. Remember Jesus is talking to his disciples - we can say Lord Lord and hold our own dreams for things such as work, family, ministry. So what more does he want?

Second we must come to him. Verse 47 says �I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words�. So the first thing we have to do is come to Jesus and hear his words. But again coming to Jesus, listening to Jesus and hearing Jesus is not enough.

The third and key step in verse 47 is he who �puts them into practice�. In short we must do them. That�s obedience.  Jesus has a great analogy that is unforgettable.  "I will show you what he is like...He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep," To dig down deep contains the idea of repentance, getting really down to the realities of my own life and deep into the truth of God. "And laid the foundation on rock."  Rock is an Old Testament term for God. And foundation is a New Testament term for Christ (1 Cor 3:11). For a house without a foundation it is only a matter of time before trouble comes and that house is destroyed. That�s why if you go to the bank and say, �I would like to buy a house that has no foundation, and is on the beach,� you will not get a loan. You will get a laugh, but not a loan. It�s only a matter of time before that house ceases to exist. In life or on death storms will come. Hardship, trials, strife and ultimately judgment will come. Jesus is looking at the foundation of our lives and asking, not who claims to be his disciple, but for those who listen to his teaching and who live the way he tells us to live. 

So as we end, there can be one of two problems. We have either a truth problem or an obedience problem. Jesus says, �comes to me and hears my words�- that�s the truth. If you are not getting a lot of truth, not studying the bible, not listening to the Holy Spirit, not listening to Godly friends then chances are you are not getting a lot of truth and don�t know what to do when the storms of life hit. May be you have a truth problem. Disciples need to watch that � we live off old knowledge and old information and in the busy rush of life can stop coming to Jesus and listening to him. Now I suspect that�s not the main problem for many here today. The problem is likely to be the other way - an obedience problem. You know what to do, you just don�t do it. James warns of what we are like: �Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.� (Jas 1:22) We deceive ourselves through bible knowledge and think that knowing a fact is the same as faith. Again to stop this being too theoretical what is the word that you should obey? What is the one word that comes to mind? What is the one thing that the Holy Spirit wants you to obey right now?  For me I have known for months that I need to kneel and pray for Jesus help at work yet instead I have simply worried and become anxious and rested when I should have prayed. 
	
In conclusion laying a foundation on rock is slow hard work. It�s not easy. There is no quick solution or short cut. Christians must stop practicing superficial faith and superficial obedience to Jesus� commands. We must dig down deep and build a foundation for discipleship on the rock. Then we will be recognized as Jesus� disciples in the end, and all of the blessings that were promised to his disciples will be ours.
