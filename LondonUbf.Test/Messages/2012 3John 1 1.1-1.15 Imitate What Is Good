IMITATE WHAT IS GOOD
3 John 1-15
Key verse 1:11
“Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.”

3 John is a very short letter with only 14 verses but it gives us insight into the reality of the early church and also wisdom in how to build our own loving community. John is writing to a man called Gaius. He is a man of integrity, a very warm hearted man with some seniority, who John feels comfortable to share his thoughts with. There are two other names mentioned in this letter, Diotrephes and Demetrius. John is writing to warn Gaius to avoid the example of Diotrephes who was spiritually ambitious and to learn instead from Demetrius. In our life of faith we are called to learn from and imitate Jesus, but we can also learn from God’s servants. Who we learn from is very important, and to a large extent determines how we grow. For that reason I have divided this message into the three names, Gaius, Diotrephes and Demetrius so we can learn the spiritual lessens from each. I pray from this letter we may learn from John, Gaius and Demetrius but not from Diotrephes! I pray we may grow into loving servants who show hospitality and work together for the truth.

I. Gaius
Look at verse 1. “The elder, To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth.” As before, Apostle John introduces himself simply as elder. There is deep personal affection towards his "dear friend Gaius." Gaius was a very common name, a bit like Kim in Korea and we don't know too much about this man outside this letter. Gaius means joy, and one gets the impression that when John thinks of him his heart is filled with joy. Some people when we think about them can make us feel a little burdened and heavy, while others make us feel real joy and encouragement. John when he thought of Gaius was full of love, but here in important phrase is ‘love in the truth.’ John's relationship with Gaius was built on the truth of Jesus's gospel. This is the foundation on which real friendship, real genuine love and understanding is shared. Last week a few of us went walking in Scotland, it was a time of fellowship, wonderful scenery, amazing food, and good humour. But what really bound us together was not just we were friends but that we shared a love of Jesus, love his word. Each morning we got up and we studied the Bible and we could delight in the truth together. Human friendship tends to be defined by common interests or compatible personalities, but Christian Fellowship runs much deeper and is based on the truth and love of Jesus.

Look at verse 2. “Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.” This was John’s prayer and blessing for Gaius. First of all, he prayed that Gaius might enjoy good health and that all may go well with him. Good health is very important, not just because it enables us to enjoy life but it is our capacity to serve God and work for his glory. Last week on the mountains I faced the limit of my fitness, Ronnie, with his long legs climbed like a mountain goat, while I was left behind red-faced and out of breath, regretting all those Big Macs and Harribo jellies. Now that I am 40 I need to be aware of what I eat and my health and energy in order to do God’s work effectively. John also says “even as your soul is getting along well.” This means that Gaius was already spiritually very healthy. The KJV translates this as “thy soul prospereth.” It means that he was not stationary in his faith but was flourishing and all the time growing. What does it mean and how do we prosper and grow in our faith? Very simply, for a soul to get along well, means to have a right relationship with God. It means to accept Jesus Christ as Saviour and accept God’s forgiving love. It means for our sins to be forgiven by God and to love as a new creation in Christ. Then, God takes away all the elements of misery in our life that has been particularly caused by our sins. He also makes us to live in his light as children of light. Like David, we need to pray with spiritual hunger and meditate on his words day and night – having an intimate relationship with him. In that way we can be sure to prosper and continue to grow in our faith and be spiritually healthy. 

Look at verse 3. “It gave me great joy to have some brothers come and tell about your faithfulness to the truth and how you continue to walk in the truth.” John said that brothers came and told him about their faithfulness to the truth. These brothers particularly reported about Gaius – saying that he not only has the truth but also walks in the truth. John was delighted by this. Look at verse 4. “I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.” John is speaking as a parent here, about his spiritual children. He has the heart of a parent. It is quite interesting to think as parents what do we want for our kids, what will make us happy to see fulfilled in their lives? Parents might have great ambition for their kids, like ‘Tiger mums,’ training them to be ‘A’ students with all kinds of extra-curricular activities. Yet as parents who know Jesus, surely what we pray for, and what will make us most happy is for our children to be faithful to the truth and walk in the truth. As parents, nothing is more joyful than our children walking in the truth. ‘Walking’ here means each and everyday enjoying Jesus, his word and fellowship, protection and leading and remaining obedient and faithful to him. When our bible students also walk in the truth, we can be so joyful.

Now, John gives the purpose of his writing. First of all, it was to commend Gaius. Look at verse 5. “Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers, even though they are strangers to you.” Gaius was faithful in serving brothers. In the early church, welcoming and serving strangers was the virtue required from all believers. (Rom 12:13; 1Tim 3:2; 5:10; Titus 1:8; 1Peter 4:9). This was at a time when there were very few, if any church buildings, a time of the Diaspora, where people, often due to persecution, found themselves on the move and needing a place to stay. We can think how the church was born in Acts, when about three thousand were added to their number in a single day (Acts 2:41). Think of all the strangers that suddenly needed care then! The early church was very fluid and alive and it needed people willing to serve strangers. In particular preachers and teachers of the gospel would pass through needing a place to stay. Gaius served those people who were travelling and preaching with love and faithfulness. Those who had received Gaius’ love testified to his love in verse 6. Look at verse 6. “They have told the church about your love. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.” It’s important that those who received Gaius’ care told about his love. This meant that they felt his love, people can be very sensitive to how they are treated, particularly when they are vulnerable and away from home. They sense the quality of care, and whether it is genuine and warm. Receiving genuine care and love at that time, receiving words of encouragement and a delicious meal really touches a person’s heart. John writes, “You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.” What is a manner worthy of God. It means to treat them as God’s children, as God himself would treat them. It means to treat them as we would Jesus himself. Jesus said, "He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me." (Mt 10:40). It was important to send them with what they needed on their journey.

Look at verse 7. “It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans.” Here we learn who the people Gaius was serving. They weren’t tourists looking for a free room at their convenience, they had gone out for the sake of the Name. they were missionaries. Their motive and desire was to hallow the name of Christ. John himself as an Apostle had been ordered by the Sanhedrin not to speak in the name of Jesus. When flogged he rejoiced at being counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the name (Acts 5:41). Such preachers when they went out had made a decision not to burden the pagans who they served. Such a mission spirit needed welcoming, honour and love. I think of Peter Park who visited us in London for 6 months, who had sacrificed so much to serve students in Nigeria, it was an honour to serve him. Look at verse 8. “We ought therefore to show hospitality to such men so that we may work together for the truth.” They became strangers for the sake of Gospel. They preached gospel to the strangers and didn’t receive any reward. They were pure hearted people who were sacrificing themselves to save souls. We ought to serve those people. Not only providing a place to stay and food to eat, we need to send them off with what they need for their future journey. By doing so, we can participate in their mission and be their co-workers – working together for the truth.  

To conclude this first part, in Gaius we find a man who loves the truth, who walks in the truth and who welcomes with love and hospitality preachers of Jesus’ name. He is a great example. In this next part we find an opposite example, one whom we learn from negatively, how not to be.

II. Diotrephes

Look at verse 9 “I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will have nothing to do with us.” “Diotrephes”, the name sounds like a form of medication, but it actually means reared or nursed by Z|eus. Apparently it was an aristocratic name, and may be this guy had a superiority complex. Before sending this letter, it John seems also to have written a letter to Diotrephes to accept those strangers, yet he didn’t accept John’s advice nor the strangers concerned. Diotrephes seems to be a very influential leader of the church where Gaius was attending. Probably he had got into a position of leadership because he was humanly capable and had convinced others. Later we are told of his power to put people out of the church. However, the first problem John identifies is ‘he loved to be first.’ It’s interesting that John puts it like this, may be he recognises in Diotrephes, the spiritual problem he onec had himself. Remember in Mt 20 his mother asked Jesus for he and his brother to sit at his right and left. John had come a long way since then, he had learned to overcome spiritual ambition and this once vengeful youth who Jesus had nicknamed the son of Boanerges had since become known as the Apostle of love. 

Yet what he identifies in Diotrephes is spiritual ambition, the desire to be number one. This spiritual pride is so damaging in a community. He didn’t welcome any one’s authority or advice. He didn’t like John giving him advice. His actions were not based on love but based on his love for power. He was spiritually immature.  Look at verse 10. “So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, gossiping maliciously about us. Not satisfied with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.” Diotrephes didn’t just refuse John’s apostolic authority but also ignored what he had written. He rejected John’s request to welcome strangers. He ignored these preachers, no doubt because their example might expose his own immaturity and challenge his authority. It seems he had become a little dictator. Not only did he not accept and welcome strangers but also banned others from doing so and he expelled those who didn’t listen to him. This kind of person can turn a church into a political party. With such a person in leadership, a church can be divided and destroyed, he can make people’s lives oppressed fearful and miserable. 

How did John warn him?  He said, “So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing” This means that he will soon come and judge him. The church in this world is not perfect like the kingdom of God yet. It is a community with mixed and flawed people – some are born again and some are not. Some are mature and some are immature. Some have been called to leadership without spiritual maturity. People who want to be number one can only be ambitious and authoritative and end up becoming a huge burden on others. Apostle John gives a clear warning to these people: “So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing.” 

III. Demetrius
Look at verse 11 “Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.” John was writing to Gaius affirming him, urging him to continually welcome and serve the servants of God and warning him not to be influenced by Diotrephes. He told him not imitate Diotrephes’s evil behaviour. When we meet a person like Diotrephes while doing good, it is easy to be discouraged and intimidated and lose our heart. They tend to be forceful, humanly capable and often good at speaking, whereas people like Gaius might not. Gaius was persecuted for serving the strangers by people like Diotrephes. However, we should not lose heart while doing good. Those who are doing good belong to God, but those who are doing evil can’t see God. 

In order to help Gaius John recommended an alternative example. Look at verse 12. “Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone— and even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true.” Who is Demetrius? He was well spoken of by people, by truth and by also Apostle John’s people. We are unsure who he is. Some say that he is the one who took this letter. However, what is obvious is that he was a lay believer with a very good influence. He was respected by everyone and was a man of integrity. In this world, people are respected by ability but in the church, we are respected by our character which should resembles that of Christ. When we reveal the fragrance of Jesus through our life of serving and love, people in this world will also be moved. This will be the same at home and also at work. Demetrius was also well spoken of by the truth. This means that when people saw his life there was no discrepancy with the word of God. The word affirmed that the way he was living was in obedience to God. If we think how this could be, it must be because of his struggle with the truth. He allowed the word of god to reveal who he actually was. He allowed it to penetrate, to reveal his pride, selfishness, ambition or whatever sin was manifest. A person does not naturally become humble, it is through prayer and spiritual struggle, sincere repentance, that our lives can be conformed to the truth. When Apostle John said of Demetrius that he is well spoken of, not just by people, not even by the Apostles but the word itself, it points to a man who each and everyday had grown mature by finding himself honestly before the word of God. 

Look at verse 13,14 “I have much to write to you, but I do not want to do so with pen and ink. I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace to you. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name.” John had many things to say but he wanted to do so face to face. John was eager to see them face to face and talk. John had many friends. Who are friends – true friends are friends who can help us when we are in need. We need to be friends to those who lose heart while serving God sacrificially like Gaius.  We need to look around whether there’s anybody like him.

From this passage I learn it matters who I imitate. I don’t want to be like Diotrephes, whose character is so obviously proud, overbearing and spiritually blind. I want to be like Gaius who knows the truth and walks by the truth and welcomes and learns from great servants of God. Yet I can see that just like the young John, there are elemts of Diotrephes in me. I can be overbearing, and demanding and spiritually proud. Yet I learn from Demetrius the way to grow mature is to keep finding myself before the word of God until the word speaks well of me. May God help us to overcome our pride and continually learn from those who are spiritually mature. May God help us to grow as spiritually through God’s word to become mature Christians.
