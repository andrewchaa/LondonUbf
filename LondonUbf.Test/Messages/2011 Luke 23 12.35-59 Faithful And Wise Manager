2011 Luke 23

FAITHFUL AND WISE MANAGER

Luke 12:35-59
Key verse 12:42
�The Lord answered, who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time?�

Today we will talk about wise and faithful manager. Through this message, Jesus is teaching us about his second coming. May God help us to be prepared for his second coming with glorious hope.

I.	Be dressed ready (35-40)
  
Look at verses 35-36. �Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, like men waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.� Jesus first of all asked his disciples to be dressed and ready for service. This means to be always ready and be spiritually alert. Second, Jesus says �keep your lamps burning�. When one has the burning lamp, they can always, at any moment, be ready to receive and welcome the master. Jesus continued by telling them to be like men waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. Normally a Jewish wedding and the reception went on into the night. It would not be easy for servants to wait for the master who is late after working all day. Yet, Jesus said � no matter how late the master is, they should be ready to receive him at any moment. 

What will happen to the servants when they do so? Look at verses 37-38. �It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. I tell you the truth, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them.� It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night. How upset the master would be if he comes back and finds all his servants sleeping? At the same time, how happy will he be when he finds all his servants waiting for him and ready to receive him � even if he comes home really late? He will be truly happy. He would be so happy that he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. Jesus is telling us this story to remind us that believers who are ready and watchful will receive the same blessing when he comes back. 
Why then should the disciples be like the servants in this passage? Look at verses 39-40. �But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.� Jesus will come like a thief. 2 Peter 3:10 says, �But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare.� When does a thief come? He always comes at a time when nobody expects. Nobody could be robbed if they know the time of the thief�s arrival. Jesus also comes at an hour when we do not expect him. Therefore, as disciples, we should live a watchful life ready for him at any moment. 
In the bible Jesus says that he is coming soon (Rev 22:7,12,20). Early believers believed that Jesus would come again in their life time. Now, 2,000 years have passed. Why is he coming so late? Apostle Peter said in 2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. Jesus is waiting for all men to repent and be saved. He waited for 2,000 years with patience. Yet, there will be a time. Sometimes, we can be relaxed about his coming since he didn�t come for the last 2,000 years. We lose our hope in his second coming and can put our hope in this world � seeking the comfort and pleasure of this world. But, Jesus said �You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.� We do not know when we will return to him. Jesus will come like a thief. What will happen if we are found asleep without keeping the lamp burning? Romans 13:11-12 says �And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.� Jesus wants us to be dressed ready for service and each day with glorious hope in his second coming. 1 Peter 1:13 also says � Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.� 
?. The Faithful and wise manager (41-48)
Look at verse 41. �Peter asked, Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?� Perhaps, Peter thought that he was ready. Jesus however didn�t answer him directly. Look at verse 42. �The Lord answered, �Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time?� This verse teaches us how the disciples should be ready for Jesus� second coming. Most of all, Jesus says that they should be faithful and wise managers. A manager looks after the properties and servants of the master. Who is then the faithful and wise manager?
First, he is faithful. Even if one is very able, he may turn out to be not so faithful. Being faithful means to give one�s whole heart to the task which the master has asked him to do. Being faithful also means to have the same attitude from the beginning to the end. A faithful manager does exactly what he was asked to do by the master � not only in the presence but also in the absence of the master, whether people recognize him or not. He carries out his responsibility to the end without abusing his privilege. Second, he is wise. Whatever we do, we need wisdom. Otherwise, managers can�t manage either servants or properties. In order to leave profit to the master, he needs to look after people and properties wisely. What is the main task of the manager then? The Lord answered, �Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time?� Giving food at the proper time was his task. Servants can be motivated and work hard when they are fed well at the proper time. Here, proper time is the time which the manager discerns is the important time for each servant. This in other words means that the manager needs to be alert and sensitive to the state of each servant, with love and care. To do so, he needs to be able to discern when each servant needs food and what kind of food they need. If one gives out all the food at once, it won�t be effective. He needs to do so faithfully and regularly. In giving the food at the proper time, therefore, the manager needs wisdom. What award will the faithful and wise manager receive then from the master? Look at verses 43-44. �It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.� The master is happy with the servant and praises him. Matthew 25:21 says, �His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' � The master trusts him and will give him more people and properties to steward. 
In the above parable, the master is Jesus and the time between the master�s absence and return refers to Jesus� ascension and second coming. Servants mean Jesus� sheep and managers are disciples or elders. Jesus taught clearly how disciples should live before his second coming as managers and shepherds over his flock. Jesus wanted them most of all to steward them faithfully with the living word of God. 
May God help us also to become faithful and wise managers who could give the bread of life � word of God- faithfully to people whom God has entrusted to us. May he particularly raise us up as a faithful and wise managers for one soul. 
On the other hand, there were some unfaithful managers. Who is he? Look at verse 45. �But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the menservants and maidservants and to eat and drink and get drunk.� Perhaps he was a good manager to begin with. Yet, when the master didn�t return soon, gradually he changed. He thought somehow the master won�t return and then he started to live not for the master but for himself. He thought that the servants are indeed not the master�s but his own. He didn�t look after them but mistreated and abused them. He completely forgot the fact that the master put them under his charge and care. He sought after his own pleasure. What happened to this manager? Look at verse 46. The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers. That manager will be severely punished this is the punishment for the unfaithful managers. Look at verses 47-48. That servant who knows his master's will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows. But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked. The managers who knew their master�s will yet didn�t do it will be punished. Those who received much will be asked for much. Those who received many more privileges and blessings will therefore be more responsible. 
?.Try hard to be reconciled to him (49-59)

Look at verse 49. �I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!� Jesus came to bring fire on the earth. Fire has the power to burn and cleanse. Through this fire, Jesus wanted to burn away all the impurity in our hearts and make our hearts clean to receive salvation. To do so, Jesus had to first receive baptism. Look at verse 50. �But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed!� Jesus� baptism meant his suffering and death on the cross. Jesus wanted to destroy the power of sin and death through his death and resurrection. And through the fire-like work of the Holy Spirit, he wanted to burn men�s sins and cleanse them. Jesus expressed how distressed he was until this was completed! This shows his deep, strong desire to save souls. 

Look at verse 51.  �Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division.� People thought that Jesus came to bring peace, yet he said that he came to bring division. What sort of division does he bring? Look at verses 52-53. �From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three. They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.� This division occurs even between the closest people. One may think there is something wrong when such division happens. Yet, Jesus says that division is natural when people decide whether they accept him or reject him. It is the spiritual battle between light and darkness and between the kingdom of God and Satan. Through division like this, people can come to faith and at the end true peace comes. Therefore, when we experience division, we should not be surprised but realise that this is because of our faith in Jesus. 
Look at verse 54-55. He said to the crowd: When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'It's going to rain,' and it does. And when the south wind blows, you say, 'It's going to be hot,' and it is. People were good at discerning weather. However, they did not discern their time � which was the time when their messiah came. They saw numerous miracles and prophecies accomplished. Yet, they did not see Jesus. They should have repented their unbelief and worldly desire. Instead, they became hypocrites. Jesus warned them what would happen if they do not repent and be reconciled to him. Look at verses 58-59. �As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled to him on the way, or he may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.� Jesus asked them to be reconciled to him on their way to the judge. The quicker the reconciliation the better. Jesus wanted them to be reconciled to him by receiving his gospel quickly before his second coming. 
In conclusion, we don�t know when Jesus will come again but we need to be ready for his coming. We need to put our hope in his glorious second coming and be dressed ready for service, keeping our lamps burning. Most of all, we need to become faithful and wise managers and be able to give the word of God at proper time to those who God has entrusted to us. Jesus will be happy when we do so and will bless us. May God help us to give all our hearts to giving the souls God entrusted the word of life at proper times!
