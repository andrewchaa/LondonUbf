2011 Luke 30

ALWAYS PRAY AND DO NOT GIVE UP

Luke 18:1-17
Key verse 18:1
�Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.�

Last week Jesus spoke of the coming Kingdom of God. Its full realization will be when Jesus returns like lightening that lights up the sky from one end to the other. It will come suddenly and unexpectedly. Now Jesus teaching on the Kingdom of God continues. How should we wait for the Kingdom? We should always pray and not give up. How do we enter the Kingdom? The tax collector shows us the way of repentance and faith. Thirdly, how must we receive the Kingdom? Like a little child.  I pray we may grow in the glorious hope of the coming Kingdom.

I. The widow�s persistent prayer (1-8)

Look at verse 1: �Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.� Jesus has been talking of his second coming. He is coming in a way that is visible to the whole world. At some point in the future when people don�t expect Jesus will return. Some will be taken others left. There will be a horrific judgement as it was in the days of Noah when a flood devastated and destroyed everyone caught in it. Jesus has been saying that he will return and establish his glorious kingdom and restore the world. So today we are between the first and second coming of Jesus. The invisible kingdom is being built and we wait for the visible new heaven and new earth. How should we live while waiting? We should always pray and not give up. That sounds good. Christians know that they should pray. We know we should not give up. But here Jesus is warning us of the danger � that we do give up, we do lose hope. We stop praying.  Maybe some here have at times given up or lost hope. Maybe some here have at times stopped praying. How does Jesus help us?

Look at verse 2: �He said: �In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.�� In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men. Most towns and villages at that time had a local judge. This was not a religious position but he would deal with civil disputes and hear and resolve local problems. But here is a picture of a wicked man � he is not moved by reverence or worship of God and he is not moved by compassion or sympathy for people. He has no interest in loving God or his neighbour. He would have been familiar with God�s standard for judges given in 2 Chronicles 19:7: �let the fear of the LORD be upon you. Judge carefully, for with the LORD our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery.� All judges would have known this passage. Yet this man was corrupt. Not only this he knows he is evil and is quite happy with it. In verse 4 he goes so far to say to himself �even though I don�t fear God or care about men�. Most people if they are evil will at least pretend a little or lie to themselves! But not this man. He is a tough hard man. The poor and weak could not expect righteous judgment from him. 

The woman we meet in verse 3 is a widow. Verse 3: �And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, �Grant me justice against my adversary.�� There was a widow in that town that was desperate to get justice. Someone had defrauded her. A widow was the most powerless of people in that society. But more so for this woman because we know she has no man in her life - such as a brother, a cousin or even a male friend who can help. We know this because men came to court. Women did not come to court � they were not permitted. But this women is alone, destitute and powerless. So it�s not going to go well for this woman. 

And what happens? Look at verse 4a: �For some time he refused.� The judge who ignored men did not even listen to her. She had no money to pay a bribe and he just ignored her requests. How easy for this destitute woman to be discouraged by his pride and coldness and to give up. But she overcame her disappointment and came to him the next day: �Grant me justice against my adversary.� The widow often came to him. As the judge got up to go to work she was outside waiting: �Morning judge! Are you dealing with my case today?� When he went to lunch there she was: �Afternoon Judge! So how�s my case going?� Returning home she popped up at his house �Evening Judge! So how�s my case?� She was utterly desperate. Yet, he did not pay attention. For a while. Then what happened? Look at verses 4b-5: �But finally he said to himself, �Even though I don�t fear God or care about men, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won�t eventually wear me out with her coming!� Even though the judge rejected her for a while, she kept coming to him until he gave up and saw that she got justice. The word in Greek for �wear me out� is a boxing term and means to �punch someone in the eye�. The judge literally feels beaten down by her and finally he gives up and gives her justice. The reason that the judge listened to her was not because of a bribe, her persuasiveness, her beauty or even a change of heart so that he become compassionate but simply because she kept bothering him. It was the victory of her persistence. It was the victory of not giving up.   

OK so that�s the story. What conclusion did Jesus draw from this parable? Why should we be encouraged this? Look at verses 6-8: �And the Lord said, �Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?� 

 �Will not God not bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night?� This parable is told to encourage us to pray and not give up. Jesus is very real about the problem we face while waiting for his return. Jesus tells us this parable because he knows the temptation is to give up while waiting.  Other translations say of verse 1 do not �lose heart� (ESV) or become �discouraged� (GNB). We hear of Jesus coming but don�t see anything. At times we pray and don�t see results and lose heart to continue. At times life does not go as we expect; things don�t work out as we thought and we despair and lose hope. In short at times we give up. 

So are we simply to read of the persistence of the widow and think �Oh OK then it worked for her so if I keep at it. If I try harder, keep on, then some day it will work out for me?�  Well partly � persistence is a good thing if its in the right direction. But Jesus is dealing here more with our faith. Jesus is painting a huge contrast in verse 7, and will not God. Jesus is pointing to the great difference with God. The judge is unrighteous but God is righteous. The judge is proud but God is full of compassion, mercy and love. The judge and the widow were strangers to each other but God is our heavenly Father and we are his chosen children. The judge felt bothered and irritated by her visits but God is pleased with his children crying out day and night. The judge despised the widow from the beginning and did not have heart to listen to her at all. But God delays his answers not because he ignores his chosen children but because he wants to give them the best answers in his best time. God wants to listen to the prayer of his chosen people. Yet, he delays his answers and trains faith and perseverance of his children and answers the best in his best time. As someone said �The Lord may not come when you want Him, but He�s always on time�. The contrast between God and this judge could not be greater.

Yet there is a problem. When we are hopeless we have a hard time believing this. We view God like the unjust judge. We think he�s not interested and forgotten us. He�s overlooked us or does not care. But your God is not like that. The good news is that Jesus is more willing to hear your prayer than we are to pray it. Jesus is saying that your heavenly father longs to hear from you � the problem is you just can�t see it right now.  You have lost sight of who your father is. 

So Jesus ends with a question and a challenge to us. Look at verse 8b: �However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?� Jesus said, �However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?� Jesus wants to find faith. Believers have no reason to be hopeless. Jesus will come again and he will make everything new. For believers there is always real hope because of Jesus death and resurrection and his Kingdom. This faith is the faith that always prays and does not give up. When we pray we gain strength through the Holy Spirit to remain until Jesus comes again. Jesus wants to see such faith. Jesus blesses such faith.  

II. The Pharisee and the Tax Collector (9-14)

Next is the parable of the Pharisee and Tax collector. We are very familiar with this but it�s a strange and surprising story. Luke doesn�t say to whom Jesus told this story, but the context of this teaching is about the Kingdom of God. Having said how to wait for the Kingdom of God Jesus moves to the attitude we need to receive the Kingdom and the false confidence that can come while waiting. Look at verse 9: �To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable.� Jesus� second parable was for those who are confident of their own righteousness and look down on everybody else. This sounds like he is dealing with the Pharisees but the truth is that at times this applies to all those with a religious life. Even the least of the disciples believed he was more righteous than others and so could judge the rest. When we live a life of faith our morality usually improves a little and so we can easily think ourselves more righteous than those who do not seem to live a spiritual life. 

Look at verses 10-13. �Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: �God, I thank you that I am not like other men � robbers, evildoer, adulterers � or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.� �But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, �God, have mercy on me, a sinner.�  

Now we all know the Pharisee is the baddie. So it�s s easy to sniff and say �what a nasty man � I�m glad I�m nothing like him�. And in doing so we can perhaps read this prayer unfairly. Now I know that there is an air of self righteousness in this prayer but looking at it in many ways it�s a godly prayer.  �The Pharisee, prayed: 'God, I thank you...'�  He�s not saying, �God, I thank me.�  He didn�t say, �God, I did a good job here.�  The credit, all of it, is being put on God.  �God, I thank you that I am not like other men, robbers, evildoers, adulterers or even like this tax collector.�  Now we should not get all high and mighty about this because everybody does this.  �Thank you, God, that you saved me from the progression of my life into wickedness.�  Any believer in this room would be in a far far worse state if it was not for God�s grace and can thank him that they are not. And we should thank him that we are not. So that is not a bad prayer.  �Thank you that I�ve not stolen; thank you that that I�ve been faithful, thank you that my evil temper has been reduced.�  As the church father Origin said �There but the grace of God go I�. This is not a bad prayer.  He�s also very faithful.  Verse 12, �I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.�  There is nothing wrong with fasting and Jesus himself fasted at times. Tithing is good and helps keep us free us from the idol of money. This is someone we would praise as a good bible student. This is someone you would want leading a bible study, teaching and serving. Yes I know we are not supposed to like him but the truth is if he was here now we would all praise him and all be rather impressed with him. 

But what about the tax collector? Look at verse 13: �But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, �God, have mercy on me, a sinner.� That�s it. Surely he could say something: �God I thank you I am not a murderer. And at least I�m not that bad. And at least I am in the synagogue�. But there is nothing religious and nothing moral at all mentioned in the tax collector�s prayer.  He is utterly broken because of his sin.

Now the next sentence is a terrifying sentence. Look at verse 14. �I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.�  The terrifying word is �this man rather than the other�. This man rather than the other went home justified. Justified is a word that means �right standing.�  So now the tax collector has right standing before God.  God has no wrath for him and he is saved. That is the amazing grace of God. But the shock is that although the tax collector has right standing before God, the Pharisee does not.  He is under God�s wrath and not in the Kingdom.

What�s the problem? As verse 9 says he was confident on his own righteousness and looked down on others. The KJV and ESV say it�s those who �trusted in their own righteousness�. He was trusting that somewhere somehow God would be a little bit pleased with his religious life and accepted him because of that. Of course the Pharisee knew he was not perfect but he thought �God must be pleased with me � look at the things I am doing�. And what about us? While waiting for the Kingdom of God we lead a religious life. Are we just a little bit pleased that we are living a life of faith? A life of mission? Do we think God may be a little bit happier with us because we seek to follow the bible? This is the danger in a life of faith. 

The tax collector was justified before God because what he said about himself and God was true. Just two things: He was a sinner and God is merciful. No justification can stand that is built on lies. In short he was justified by faith alone. Now as believers we know this. We say �of course it�s by faith�. We experienced this. We were once unbelievers and come to faith and our lives changed. We accepted Jesus and started to get more freedom, things got better. We started to pursue righteousness and our lives looked cleaner. But as we go very often Christ starts to become nowhere in sight. We live a religious life and begin to exalt ourselves, even if we don�t do it with our mouths but we do it with our lives, and then we look down at others. The biggest sign of this is judging others and criticizing. Looking across at others and finding our eyes looking down. But as Hebrews says Jesus is not only the author of our faith. He is the perfecter of our faith (Heb 12:2).  Entry to the Kingdom starts with Jesus alone and finishes with Jesus alone. 

Jesus summed up his teaching about waiting for the kingdom of God through a small event in his ministry. Look at verses 15-17. �People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, �Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.�� Children trust their parents absolutely. They come to their parents not because they feel deserving, but because they believe their parents love them. And they trust that what their parents say is right, even if the rest of the world disagrees. Now, of course, we are all grown up and don�t trust anybody but ourselves. It is not good or right. We can�t trust in the world, and we can�t trust in ourselves. We can and should trust in God always as our Heavenly Father. That is how to receive the Kingdom of God.

In conclusion Jesus will bring the Kingdom of God. When? We don�t know. But we can have real hope because Jesus will come and will make all things new. Through his death and resurrection we know that our sins are paid for in full and Jesus will welcome us into his kingdom. May we not lose sight of this great hope, pray and not give up.
