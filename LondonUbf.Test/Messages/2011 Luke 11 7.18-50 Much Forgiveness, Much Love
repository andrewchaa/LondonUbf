2011 Luke 11

MUCH FORGIVENESS, MUCH LOVE

Luke 7:18-50
Key verse 47
�Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven�for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.�

In today�s passage we witness two events. Firstly we see John the Baptist who Jesus calls the greatest man born of woman. Through looking at the life of John we can think how we can also be great in Jesus� sight. Secondly we meet two people: Simon the Pharisee, a morally upstanding citizen who invites Jesus to his house for a meal and we also meet a sinful woman whose many sins are known to the whole town. My prayer is that through this passage God may help us to see these two characters clearly and find ourselves in both of them. Jesus is inviting us to ask ourselves �who am I in this story?� and �How is my relationship with Jesus?� May God help us to repent of our critical and judgemental spirits and find freshly the amazing grace of Jesus in our lives. 

1. Great in the sight of Jesus (18-35)

Look at verse 18a �John�s disciples told him about all these things.� John was in prison. He was a pure man, of God. He preached a message of judgement and baptised people with a baptism of repentance. As a result of his message many people repented and turned back to God. However, when he challenged Herod over his adulterous relationship with his brother�s wife, Herod had John thrown in Prison. From prison John could not see what Jesus was doing yet he started to hear many different stories from his disciples and what he heard did not sit well with him. When John had spoken about Jesus he had said �His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.� John knew that Jesus was the Christ yet he believed that judgement, fire and God�s wrath would follow him. He had expected him to judge the sinful and yet he was hearing stories of Jesus being a friend of tax collectors and sinners.

John had not expected to be in the position that he was in. He would have known that if you�re locked up in prison by Herod, there was a fair chance that he would die in prison. John had believed that Jesus was the messiah he had put all of his hope in Jesus, yet now, faced with death, and after hearing all of these strange reports about Jesus he was starting to doubt if Jesus was really was the one. If Jesus was not the messiah then John had just sacrificed his life for nothing. John wanted assurance about Jesus. So what did he do? 

Look at verse 18b-19 �Calling two of them, he sent them to the Lord to ask, �Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?� John did not allow himself to be defeated by doubt instead he sent two of his disciples to Jesus to ask him clearly if he was the one. Was he the one who would lead all men to the kingdom of heaven, was he the one who would bring peace to the people, was he the one who would judge the nations, was he the Christ?

Living by faith is not always simple or easy. Like John we commit our lives to Jesus but sometimes we do not receive the life or blessings that we expect. We make sacrifices for the gospel. We give up comfort, money and in many cases our home countries. When expect that we will save souls, raise disciples, get good jobs, live fruitful and prosperous lives. But we can find the reality is very different. We face misunderstanding, rejection, financial difficulties, bearing fruit is not easy. We look at our lives and they do not match our expectation. In those times we can face similar doubts to John. �Is Jesus really who he says he is?� �Have I made the right choice in following Jesus, or should I have followed something else?� At those times what should we do? To whom should we go to? John got up from his doubt and went to Jesus, he did not ask his disciples what they thought, he asked the man himself. When we face such questions we need to get up and get to Jesus. Go to his word and read, fall to our knees and pray. In the next verses we see that Jesus does not condemn us or reject us when we have these types of questions, he wants to help us, he wants to encourage us and build us up in our faith. 

Look at verse 21-22 �At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. So he replied to the messengers, �Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.� Who has the right to question Jesus authority and identity? The answer is no one! No one has the right to go to Jesus and say �are you the one? Because you don�t quite match up to what I was expecting.� Yet that is effectively what John is saying. But Jesus is amazing, he does not judge or condemn John, rather he humbles himself and helps him to overcome his doubt. First he said �look, see what I am doing� and then Jesus helped John to come back to the word of God, revealing that he was fulfilling the scripture that Isaiah had written about him. (Isa 35) Jesus did not change john�s situation, he would indeed die in prison, but Jesus wanted John to have faith in him. Jesus does not want us to suffer in doubt he wants to come to him, grow in faith and confess that Jesus is the one, he is the Christ. 

Finally Jesus gives John great words of encouragement. Look at verse 23 �Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.� Jesus is saying, that though he is suffering, though he may not be where he wants to be right now and though Jesus does not seem to be doing what he expected him to do, if John holds onto Jesus he will be blessed, he will receive true peace and eternal life.

John's disciples left. Then Jesus turned his attention to the crowd. Jesus knew that there was confusion about John the Baptist because he was in prison. So Jesus asked them a series of rhetorical questions about John and his ministry. Look at verse 24b. "'What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?'" Obviously people do not go into the desert to look at grass. Had they gone into the desert to see a man dressed up in the finest clothes? Obviously not, considering that John wore an unfashionable camel's hair cloak. 

Then, why had these people gone out into the desert? They had gone out to see a prophet. Jesus exclaimed �Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written: ��I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.� (28,29) John was more than a prophet, he was the one that Malachi had prophesied about, He was the one who spoke directly about Jesus. He had called people to repentance in order that their hearts may be prepared and ready to accept Jesus into their lives. 

When the people looked at John they saw a man in prison, they perhaps thought that he was weak, helpless or that he was in some way cursed by God but in verse 28 Jesus said �I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John.� Jesus saw John very differently; Jesus saw that John was the greatest man ever to live. This is a massive claim, so why was he so great? To Jesus, John was great because he was the prophet who had prepared the way for him. The world tends to define greatness by one�s ability and achievement. People revere such people as Albert Einstein, William Shakespeare or Nelson. But in Jesus� eyes John is far greater. The question for us is in who�s eyes do we want to be great? Do we want to be great in the world�s eyes through achievement and success? Or do we want to be great in Jesus� eyes? In order to be great in Jesus� eyes we need to follow in the footsteps of John and prepare the way for Jesus. Those people who preach the gospel, who call people to repentance and bring them to Jesus, they are the ones who Jesus says are great. Jesus sees our lives, he sees and honours our sacrifice. When we serve Jesus by faith we can look forward to him saying to us �well done my good and faithful servant�

John preached that all people must repent of their sins and be baptized. All people, even the tax collectors received John�s teaching, repented and were baptized. And yet, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law rejected John. They regarded themselves as righteous, and did not want to be baptized believing that as descendants of Abraham they were ok. What did Jesus compared this unbelieving generation to? Look at verse 32. �They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: �We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.� Who then are those who do not dance when children play the pipe, and those who do not cry when children sing a dirge? Look at verse 33, 34. �For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, �He has a demon.� The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, �Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.� They criticised John that he was demon-possessed, though he lived pure life and preached the message of repentance. They accused Jesus of being a friend of tax collectors and the sinners, though he delivered the gospel and a message of forgiveness. It did not matter what God did in order to call his people back to him, whether he was tough or gentle, the people always found fault and criticised. Through this they revealed their stubbornness and refusal to repent. God is always working through his servants helping us to repent and come to him. When we find that critical spirit in ourselves we must ask why? Are we being critical because we are challenged and do not want to repent?


2. Much forgiveness, much love (36-50)

Look at verse 36 �Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee�s house and reclined at the table.� Throughout the book of Luke we tend to find that he paints a very negative picture of the religious leaders, they are critical of Jesus to the point that they are thinking of ways that they might kill him. Yet, here we see one of these very same leaders inviting Jesus to dinner. It initially appears that he wants to serve Jesus. However, as we read through the text it becomes clear that this Pharisee�s motives were not pure, he was sizing Jesus up. He wasn�t so sure about Jesus. This is clear because of the common courtesies that he did not show towards Jesus.  For instance, Jesus later in the passage will tell you, that He was not greeted with a customary kiss at the door. Nor did the host provide someone to wash his dirty feet or anoint him with oil as a gesture of respect. No, Simon the Pharisee was deliberately rude to Jesus. It was an unwelcoming atmosphere but Jesus still went along, he had a heart for all people and he always tried to teach the religious leaders about the heart of God.

Look at verse� 37 �When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee�s house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,� While the men were reclining and chatting an uninvited guests came towards the table, this was unacceptable, not only that but the woman who approached the table was notoriously sinful. We do not know what her sin was but many commentators suggest that she was either a prostitute or an adulterer. To really understand this woman and to know her agony we need to understand the culture that she was living in. This is a highly religious, judgemental, Middle Eastern culture. Even today women in the Middle East suffer. For example in Sudan woman are ostracised by her community and even murdered because they are suspected of having engaged sexual relations. They say that the loss of a woman�s virginity is a shame which can only be wiped out in blood. That is today, now go back 2000 years and imagine the highly aggressive, religious state that she lived in. Now imagine that everybody knew her sin and everybody judged and condemned her for it.

So, what is that woman doing there? Look at verse 38 �and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.� This woman did not come to the Pharisees house to size Jesus up, she came to worship him and show her undying gratitude to him for the grace that she had received. Luke does not tell us, but, it appears that this woman has come across Jesus� path prior to this event and has already received grace from him. She has either been there in the crowds as he has taught in this town, or maybe there�s been some sort of a personal encounter when he has convicted her of her sins but also preached the Gospel to her, we don�t know. But somehow she knows who this man is and she knows his message and he has already changed her life.  

At this kind of meal the table would be low to the ground and the men would be reclining on cushions and pillows with their feet going away from the table. Luke tells us that this woman came up behind Jesus and as she came close to him an unexpected thing happened. Suddenly she lost control and just started to weep uncontrollably. Tears were pouring down her face, her makeup was running, they ran onto her dress, she was a mess. But where did these tears come from? It appears that as she approached Jesus she suddenly got a sense of his absolute holiness and her utter sinfulness. She realised before Jesus that she had been living an utterly corrupted and wicked life, she realised that she deserved to be condemned, she was a helpless and broken sinner. However, she also knew that Jesus forgave her, he did not condemn her but he loved her. Luther describes her tears as her �Heart water� these tears were coming from her heart. These were tears of repentance and gratitude for the grace she had received. When was the last time that you wept for your sin? Have you ever wept because of your sins? If not then maybe you need to come to Jesus again and find his purity and holiness. It is true that the closer we come to Jesus the more deeply and clearly we see our sinfulness.
 
Suddenly she looked down and she realised that her tears were pouring onto Jesus� feet, so much so that they began to wash off the dirt that Simon had failed to wash off when Jesus entered into his house. Then she did something amazing, she let down her hair, which Paul would later describe as a woman�s glory, and began to wipe his feat with her hair. Some rabbis in Jesus� time told husbands that they had the right to divorce their wives if their wives ever let their hair down in front of another man? Culturally what she was doing was unacceptable. But she did not care what anybody thought about her! She didn�t care what they know about her; because this man knew her heart and saw her sin and he forgave her. All she wants to do is praise him and express her gratitude and her love. All she cares about is Jesus.

She then breaks open an alabaster perfume bottle and pours the perfume onto Jesus� feet. We know from Josephus that these bottles were very, very important to Jewish women. They were so important that the rabbis had made an allowance for the women to wear them on the Sabbath day. And here she is taking her most precious possession and pouring them on a man�s feet. Why is she doing this? What is the point? We need to see that this is her form of worship. She is taking the things that are most precious to her, her hair which was her glory and her perfume which was all of her savings and she was offering them all to Jesus. She did not want to hold anything back from him. She was worshiping Jesus with her whole life. When we know Jesus� grace we want to offer him all of our life.

All the while, Simon is looking at her with contempt. And what�s worse, he is looking at Jesus with contempt. Look at verse 39 �When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, �If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is�that she is a sinner.� Jesus responds by asking him a question look at verse 41-42 �Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he cancelled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?� One commentator said that this is the most simple parable in the Bible, thus Simon is insulted, he replied, �I suppose the one who had the bigger debt cancelled.� Jesus kept it simple because Jesus wanted to teach him a simple lesson which he did not understand, God's view of sinners. God sees that the one who has a greater sense of sin, and has those sins forgiven, will love him more.

Simon didn�t get it. He could answer the question right, but his heart is cold and loveless. He had no love for Jesus because he had not been forgiven and, tragically, he doesn�t think he needs to be forgiven. His pride and the desire to look good in front of his peers stopped him being honest about his sin. So he sat alone and judged everyone apart from himself. It is always dangerous when you look with greater contempt on the sins of others than you look on the wickedness of your own heart.  And that is exactly where Simon was doing. The fact of the matter is Simon needed to be forgiven just as much as the woman but, unlike her, he was blind to his sin.  

In verses 44-46 Jesus tied to help Simon by comparing him to the woman. Simon saw himself as a moral and upstanding figure in society and yet he had failed to show Jesus the most basic of common courtesies. Jesus was pointing out to him that he is in fact sinful and rude; whereas this, so called sinful woman, had shown him greater grace and affection than he ever could. Jesus pointed out that the woman's love was wholehearted, affectionate, humble and sacrificial. However, the Pharisee was cold hearted and loveless. Jesus is saying �Simon you need to learn from her.�

Jesus concluded in verse 47, "Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little." Here we must realize two things. First, we learn that what Jesus wants is our love: love for him and love for others. We should be most concerned about love. As we learned in 1 Corinthians 13, even if we do many great things, if we have not love, it is nothing. Love is the essential attribute that Jesus wants us to have. So we have to pay attention to how much we love Jesus and others. We should be happy when our love is flaming hot, and we should be sad and repent if our love grows cold. 

Secondly, Jesus teaches us there is a relationship between Jesus' grace to us and our love for Jesus. The woman�s love for Jesus overflowed because she had received so much grace. Those who truly receive the grace of forgiveness of sins will love Jesus with all their hearts. The more one receives grace, the more he or she will love Jesus. However, if love for Jesus is not alive in our hearts, there is something lacking.

It is vital for our relationship with Jesus that we remain humble and like this woman, find our sin and grow in Jesus� grace. When we first come to Jesus we are like her, we are humble, broken and repentant and as a result Jesus� grace and our love for him is abundant. Yet as time goes by, very often, we become more like Simon. Morally our lives improve so we see ourselves as better than others in the world who lead morally corrupt lives, we live in Christian community and do not want to be seen as weak, we fear what other people will think of us, we worry that people will talk about us behind our backs and judge us so we hide our sins. We become competitive with others and want to be seen as more holy so we stop confessing our sins and hide behind a veil of false pride. The consequence of this is that we become blind to sin, our sense of grace dies and our love for Jesus grows cold. 

What can we do? Firstly we need to intellectually come back to the cross of Jesus, spend time thinking about who we were and who we are, and find ourselves again at the foot of the cross. This is not an easy process; it takes spiritual struggle before the word and time in prayer. 

Secondly we need to create an environment where people are free to repent. Each of us can be critical like Simon; we judge each other, especially in the small things. �That person�s attendance is not good; they are not working hard enough, struggling enough...� When we judge each other over small things we stop people being free to confess the big things, people�s hearts close up and we cause others to hide their sin. We need to create an environment where people can freely confess their sins. A place where we do not judge, do not gossip but love and pray for each other. When we create that kind of environment people will be able to freely come to Jesus and receive his grace. The more grace we have the more we will love Jesus.

Look at verse 50 �Jesus said to the woman, �Your faith has saved you; go in peace.�� The woman was saved by faith. She had lived in mental and spiritual torment because of her sin, but when she confessed before Jesus she could live in peace.

In summary, When we have a small sense of sin we have a small love for Jesus, yet when we deeply understand who we are before Jesus and have a great sense of sin, then our love for Jesus overflows. May God help us find ourselves before the holiness of Christ, repent and renew the grace of Jesus in our lives. May God help us to repent of our critical and judgemental spirit, love others and love Jesus more than anything else in the world.
