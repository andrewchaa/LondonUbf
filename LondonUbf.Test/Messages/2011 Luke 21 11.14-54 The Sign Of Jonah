THE SIGN OF JONAH


Luke 11:14-54
Key Verse 11:29
�As the crowds increased, Jesus said, �This is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.��

Jesus popularity is now increasing and thousands are gathering to hear him. Whole villages and towns must be deserted as people come out to catch a glimpse of him and to hear Jesus speak. Yet Jesus� response is to call the generation wicked. It�s a tough blunt message. It�s God�s judgment on a nation and people. But Jesus does not condemn and leave without hope � rather he gives a sign of God�s love and hope through the sign of Jonah. Despite the wickedness of this world there is real hope as shown through the sign of Jonah. The question is what is our response to the sign of Jonah? May God help us to see the sign and follow its direction.

Look at verse 14:�Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke and the crowd was amazed�. Jesus had come across a man who was gripped by a demon that meant he was mute. The man was so twisted in his mind and heart that he was unable to speak. He was imprisoned in his own body and because of the grip of this demon he lived a crippled damaged life. One in which he could not communicate and his relationships were broken. No one was powerful enough to drive out the demon. No doubt the man and his family would have tried ways to help but nothing worked. But Jesus had power to drive out the demon. When Jesus drove out the demon from the man, he spoke and was set free. Jesus liberated and healed this tormented man. This was the work of the Messiah which Isaiah had prophesised when he spoke �freedom for the prisoners� and the �deaf hearing�. (Isa 35:5, 42:7, 61:1).

What was the response of the people? They were amazed. (14b) And rightly so. Clearly to see a man go from the prison of silence to speaking is remarkable. To be amazed is a right and logical response to seeing this. It does not necessarily mean that those who saw had faith but it�s a good start to be amazed at Jesus. Yet there were some people who criticised. They said �By Beelzebub, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.� (15). Others tested Jesus by asking for a sign from heaven. 

Beelzebub or in Greek �Lord of the flies� goes back to the Old Testament to refer to lord of the dung...lord of the manure, a very popular term for the prince of demons, Satan. In 2 Kings 1:2-3 King Ahaziah after seriously injuring himself in a fall, sends messengers to inquire of Ba�al Zeb�b, the god of the Philistine city of Ekron. They were saying that Jesus is an agent of the dung-god. Therefore to call someone this was the highest insult. Some might say, "I'd never say that...I think Jesus is a good person and I would never say that about him." But in a sense the Jews were right about the choice to be made. They knew there was no middle ground. They knew there was no harmonizing, patronizing nonsense that Jesus is a good man, a good teacher who meant well. Those saying Jesus was working by the power of Satan knew the truth that Jesus is either God or he's the greatest blasphemer who ever lived. He either speaks for God or he speaks for Satan. That's it. He is either the Son of God, or isn�t. And if he is not, then Jesus is the biggest liar that ever lived and the biggest blasphemer who ever lived who pulled off the biggest deception in history. They knew there was only one other conclusion. He is an insane, demon-possessed deceiver or God. Those are your options. Today people are faced with the same choice. Many try and duck this and think there is some middle category but as Jesus says in verse 23 �he who is not with me is against me�. You are with Jesus as God or you are with Satan.

How does Jesus respond to this view of him? Look at verses 17-18: �Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: �Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall. If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub.� Jesus gave them the benefit of the doubt by assuming that they were genuinely mistaken so he pointed out that what they said was not logical. If Jesus had driven out the demon by the power of Beelzebub, the kingdom of the devil could not stand. Their conclusion was illogical. It was also inconsistent. The followers of the Pharisees had also driven out demons yet they did not say this about them. Many of the so called conclusions about Jesus today are equally as irrational � he was a good man, he never said he was God; his followers invented Christianity and so on. But Jesus leaves no such choice � �he who is not with me is against me�.

Having done this Jesus again invited them to consider the alternative in verse 20: �But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you�. That he drives out demons by the finger of God means by the Spirit of God. (Mt 12:28) The mute demon had controlled the man and kept him from speaking. But Jesus drove out the demon and the man was ruled by God. Jesus compared Satan�s kingdom on earth to that of a strong man who is fully armed and stands watch over his house and possessions. Satan guards jealously what belongs to him. This is a profound insight into the spiritual world. Yet most of the time we�re not aware of Satan�s rule over this world. Things go along smoothly enough. But it is a deception. As soon as we try to change, to stop committing sins and to overcome ourselves and our selfish desires to do something good and right, it feels like the whole world is against us. And it is! When we want to pray � we find it�s hard to stop and kneel. When we want to sit and read the bible we find other things come in. We want to be better in our attitude; better in our relationships; we resolve to change but find its hard and good resolve is soon lost. We don�t feel Satan�s grip on our lives until we try to remove it. Good intentions are never enough and we need Jesus power in order to be free from Satan�s grip and come out of his kingdom. Jesus is stronger than Satan. Jesus is stronger than any spiritual or physical force in this world and he is able to drive out the darkness. We need his power. What happens when we try and clean up our lives without this power? 

Look at verses 24-26:  �When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first.� Jesus is talking to the Pharisees. He speaks here of someone who is like a house �swept clean and put in order�. The word in Greek is �kosmeo�� from which we get the word �cosmetic�. 

This refers to someone who has cleaned up their life and put things in outward order. They turn from their life of crime or their life of immorality, or whatever.  But in doing so it�s still empty. They may be moral and outwardly clean but inside it�s an empty house; a spiritual vacuum without reformation. We often think of demons as resulting in dirty immoral lives but Jesus is talking to the Pharisees and teachers of the law who lead moral outwardly �good� lives. In Matthew 23:15 Jesus spoke of their outward zeal where they travel over land and sea to win a single convert yet the result? They �make him twice as much a son of hell� as they are. Morality without Jesus makes people double sons of hell.  Morality kicks the door wide open for more demons.  John Macarthur rightly points out that it is better to be immoral than moral without Christ.  It is better to be irreligious than religious without Jesus.  Why? Because morality and religion trick us into thinking we are OK. Worse than immorality are those lives swept clean lives without power and transformation of Jesus. 

This is challenging for believers as well. We can think at times we need to �clean up our lives�, �get back on track�. We live moral lives yet sometimes lack power; we do what is outwardly religious yet inside can remain unchanged and can be held in pride, bitterness and inward sins. It�s trying to live a life of faith in our own strength. To this Jesus warns there is no benefit in reformation without regeneration.  Miracles or morality are not enough. We need nothing less than the transforming power of Jesus. 

But how? If miracles or morality are not the way what is?  Look at verse 29: �As the crowds increased, Jesus said, �This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.�� 

First this is a wicked generation. This was Jesus judgement on Israel. Before Jesus had called Israel an �unbelieving and perverse generation� and asked �how long shall I stay and put up with you� (Lk 9:41) and now the judgement is in � this is a wicked generation. When we think of �wickedness� images of terrible things may come to mind � the attempted rape of angels as at Sodom or Gomorrah; The child sacrifice to Molech; sexual immorality, violence and the like. Yet if we saw Israel then we would say it was an incredibly religious and moral generation. What is the wickedness that Jesus is speaking of? Look again at verse 29 � �it asks for a miraculous sign�. Their asking for a miraculous sign was wicked. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be sure about God and certain of his reality and truth. But the people had already seen many miraculous signs such as the mute man speaking; lepers being healed; lame men walking; thousands being fed from almost nothing. They had heard incredible preaching with authority. Their problem was not signs but their motive in asking for signs. In truth, they did not want to believe. The problem was not lack of evidence but the inconvenience of becoming a disciple of Jesus knowing the inevitable changes that would have to occur.  This is what marks a wicked generation. This is evil. 

So what does Jesus say? To those people, Jesus �none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.�

You know the story of Jonah. God had told Jonah to go to Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, to preach the message of judgement. Yet he did not want his enemy people to repent and be saved. He got on board a ship bound the other direction. God sent a strong wind and the ship was about to break up. Jonah was thrown into the sea where he was in a great fish for three days and three nights. By the grace of God he survived the spiritual discipline and went to Nineveh to preach the word of God. He went reluctantly and probably spoke with little heart or concern yet amazingly the people of Ninevah repented in sackcloth� from the greatest to the least. So what does this mean?

First the sign of Jonah. Notice in verse 30 that �Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites�. Jonah himself was the sign. How was Jonah a sign? The fact that he lived in the stomach of the fish for three days and three nights was a great miracle. This miracle was a clear sign for the Ninevites to realise that he was a servant of God. Yet they hadn't personally experienced that miracle.  Maybe they found the large fish but they did not see this. Rather he told them the account of what happened and they believed him.  They believed this was a message from the true God, not because they had the Scripture, but because God had done a miracle which they believed only God could do and therefore this message was true. Likewise, as Jonah was swallowed by the great fish, Jesus was swallowed into the grave.  As Jonah's career should have ended, Jesus' career should have ended.  As Jonah was miraculously delivered from certain death, Jesus was actually raised from death.  The sign of Jonah then is the resurrection of the dead, from the dead.  What was the final sign? The resurrection.  What greater sign could there possibly be?  Jesus conquered death and was raised to life. This is a clear sign that he is the promised Messiah. No other miraculous sign is necessary. That Jesus died on the cross for our sin and he rose again from the dead is the gospel. The gospel is the power of God, which gives salvation to all those who believe. (Ro 1:16). What matters is our response to this sign. Yesterday to make the point to Samuel I made a sign that pointed to some chocolate and asked �do you want the sign or do you want to follow which way it points?� I will leave you to guess which one he chose. The sign of Jonah is the gospel. It points to the fact that we are sinners facing death and God�s wrath and that either we pay the price of our sin or accept Jesus payment on our behalf. When we sincerely repent and believe the gospel, it changes us. The gospel makes us a new creation. The gospel heals us spiritually and physically. Yet some people seek other miraculous signs: The sign of God�s love through a good job, happy family, miraculous healing, success, and so on. If these things are not given, they doubt God and his love. They are those who test God with a miraculous sign like the Pharisees. The serious problem of those who seek miracles or signs is that they are more interested in miracles or idols than in the living God. 

Second none will be given it. In short Jesus is saying you don�t need any more. You don�t need any more miracles; you don�t need any more preaching. You don�t need any more evidence. God has done enough. And now you must make up your mind and decide. Stop making excuses. Some people go on for years and years without ever making a clear choice and accepting the gospel. Some people wait for God to give a sign, or think that somehow God has been unfair and not done enough. They want him speak in a particular way or do something � often I suspect they are not quite sure what they are waiting for - but whatever it is Jesus says �none will be given it�. People hesitate to make a firm commitment to Jesus in the vague belief that something will happen. But as Hebrews says "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts." (Heb 4:7). You don�t need more evidence.

Third repentance. Jesus is contrasting the people of Nineveh with the people of his generation.   The people of Nineveh repented.  The people of his generation didn�t.  The people of Nineveh knew very little of the Bible.  The people of His generation knew a lot about the Bible and they knew a lot about God.  The Queen of the South knew little but she came and responded.  This may be a little hard but there is a warning here for those of us that know a lot about the bible. Some grow up from an early age schooled in the truth yet their hearts are cold. Yet sometimes people with almost no knowledge of the bible hear the gospel and change while others with apparently lots of knowledge hardly move or change. What�s the problem? It�s that over time people can be satisfied with making sure they look good on the outside, that they are externally religious and spiritual, but inside their hearts are darkened and hard and they haven�t repented.  There�s a message for us in this passage.  Don�t play external games with God.  Christianity is a religion of the heart and an unrepentant heart does not know God.  It does not matter how much bible we know or how much we know about God but whether we have repented and embraced the Gospel of Christ.  This is a word for us. 

Yet despite the clear teaching most do not accept. What is the problem? As Jesus will show it�s a problem of sight not lack of light. Look at verse 33: �No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. He puts it on its stand so that those who come in may see the light.� This is a slightly obscure passage but what is clear is that Jesus is talking about light and dark. Jesus came as the light of the world. He spoke and taught openly (Jn 18:20). Today it�s estimated that about 75% of the world at least know of Jesus. Very few can say that they know nothing whatsoever of Jesus. So the problem is not a lack of light. The problem is not that God is hiding or making it difficult or has not done enough. It is not that God has done half of what he needs to do and we struggle to make up the difference. Rather the issue is whether we will open our spiritual eyes or not. Verse 35 says �see to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness�. We must examine ourselves to see whether our insides are dark or bright. We can have good spiritual eyes by repenting and making our hearts humble. 

In verse 37-53 we see Jesus� tough rebuke and judgement on the Pharisees. There is a lot we can say but the fundamental problem is that they did not accept the sign of Jonah. They did not accept Jesus� diagnosis that man is utterly sinful and in need of salvation. They set up their own religious system with its own religious rules and codes and preferred this to the sign of Jonah. 

In conclusion, God has given us the sign of Jonah. The sign of Jonah is the sign of Jesus� death. It is the sign that we are utterly sinful and cannot pay the price of our sin. The sign of Jonah is the resurrection of Jesus � that Jesus has defeated sin and death. God has done enough. Instead of seeking a miraculous sign, we must accept the gospel of Jesus� death and resurrection. The gospel of Jesus that he died for our sins and rose again from the dead is the biggest miracle of all. May God help us to respond to this great sign with repentant hearts like the Ninevites. Amen!
