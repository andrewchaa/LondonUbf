2011 Luke 3

JESUS OVERCAME SATAN�S TEMPTATION

Luke 4:1-15
Key Verse Luke 4:8
�Jesus answered, �It is written: �Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.�

We see in today�s passage that at the very beginning of Jesus� ministry he confronts the devil�s temptation. Just two figures, Jesus and the devil and yet everything was at stake. At stake was the salvation of mankind, the eternal destiny of every man�s soul. The message is in two parts: first we can think about the meaning of Jesus temptation and victory as the Son of God, and then can find out how Jesus defeated the devil. Every person is tempted by Satan, we can ask ourselves how am I being tempted? What is the bait he is using, are we looking just at the pleasurable bait or do we see the devil�s gruesome hook with which he wants to capture our hearts and drag us away from God and into slavery? When we understand how Jesus defeated Satan we can find how we can be victorious when tempted. 

1. �The Meaning of Jesus� temptation (1-2a)

Look at verses 1-2a. Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil.� 

If we remember last week�s passage Jesus was humbly baptized by John the Baptist. And when he was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: �You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.� Now in this verse we have just read Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, then left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the desert, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. It seems a strange thing, remember a couple of weeks ago we studied the Lord�s Prayer and Jesus taught his disciples to pray �Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one�? Yet here God himself is leading Jesus to be tempted by the devil. Why? The answer lies in who Jesus is and what he came to do. Jesus is the Son of God, his mission, first described in Ge 3:15 was to crush Satan�s head. God wanted his son to succeed where Adam the first man had failed, by defeating the temptation of the devil. Adam and Jesus are unique in human history in that they both were without a sinful nature. For that reason they both had a real chance to succeed in defeating the devils� temptation. They are regarded as the ancestors of the human race. (Ro 5:14) They are representative of the human race when it comes to the devil�s temptation. When Adam failed all of humanity fell with him. When Jesus won the victory he did so on behalf of all those who believe in him. Roman�s 5:19 says, �For just as the through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.�

Adam and Jesus were both without sin when they were tempted by the devil, but they were tempted in very different environments. Adam was in the Garden of Eden, paradise. He had every tree that was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and yet when temptation came, he disobeyed God and listened to his wife and ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Since that time the earth and man has been under a curse, under the power of sin and death, the earth producing thorns and thistles for man. The environment Jesus was now in was the desert of Judea (Mt 3:1) also known as Jeshimon, ( 1Sa 23:24) which means devastation. When we went to Israel in January we got a sense of how utterly dry and without life the environment was, hardly any water, rocks and dust and wind. It must have been unbearably hot, like a vast furnace. The water of the Dead Sea which is near there gets so hot in summer that it burns your feet just to paddle in it. Jesus had no place to lay his head, he was alone, in this waste land.

Here we really see Jesus as a man. Jesus came to save mankind who had failed to overcome the devil�s temptation and trials. But for Jesus to save us, he had to first be tempted by Satan and overcome. If he could not overcome the temptation, he could not help us to overcome either. Also, Jesus was tempted so that, as God, he could understand and sympathise with us. Heb 4:15 says, �For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are�yet was without sin�. Jesus was tempted in the desert just as we are, in every way. Therefore, he understands our limit and weakness perfectly. He is our Saviour who understands our weakness and sympathises with us. 

2 Jesus defeats the devil�s temptation with the word of God

First, man does not live on bread alone. Jesus was in the desert for forty days and all the time he was being tempted by the devil. The devil at all costs wanted to defeat Jesus and prevent him from fulfilling his mission. We know Jesus had God�s personal word to him, �You are my Son whom I love,� yet this was a spiritual battle that needed his intense fasting and prayer. Verse 2b says that �He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.� I don�t know how long anyone here has fasted; I have never managed more than a day. To have fasted for 40 means to be at the point of near organ failure, Jesus� physical situation was critical. He was alone and exhausted and in such a weakened state the devil plays really dirty. 

Look at verse 3. �The devil said to him, �If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.� What Satan is saying sounded practical and reasonable. It seemed that he would need to eat to get his full strength back to be able to serve the ministry. After all it�s not a sin to eat when you need to. What was Satan�s trap? How was he testing Jesus? First, at issue was how Jesus was to use his divine power. In John 5:19 Jesus said, �I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing....� Jesus used his power only according to God�s will and leading. Jesus never used his miraculous power to satisfy his own appetites. This would not have pleased the Father and it would have violated the principle of incarnation as the Son of God.

Later Jesus would face this kind of temptation when faced with a large crowd of 5,000.
Out of compassion he fed them with five loaves and two fish. Yet when they again asked for more bread, Jesus was in danger of becoming a �bread messiah�, where people would follow him for bread rather than out of desire for God. (Jn 6:34) Jesus wanted people to follow him, but not for bread, he wanted them to follow him to the cross. He had come not to give people bread but to save the world from sin. Jesus resisted the temptation by offering the crowd only his flesh and blood, (Jn 6:53) However, When he did so, many deserted him. From this one can see how subtle the devil is. From now on he would be trying to tempt Jesus to avoid the cross.

Secondly this temptation goes to the heart of what a man lives for. Since Adam�s sin man has had to toil just to survive (Ge 3:17-19). From that time until now we have been tempted to live for bread rather than to live for God. It is true that we human beings need bread to survive. Yet the temptation is to seek bread as our priority and virtually abandon God in the pursuit of bread. We can think of bread or money as the same. �Bread� is London slang for money. In our society, there is a constant pressure to earn money for security. Under the pressure of this economic climate, people become more fearful about just to surviving, they become anxious and desperate. Christmas time is particularly pressured, when credit cards are pushed to their maximum. People become workaholics and ignore their families and their own health in order to pursue money. Students fear debt as a result of the increase in fees, and when they are not demonstrating against the government, they seem to have no time for anything except study so they can get good grades, and a good job, and then make money for a secure future. Living in this way, people develop many kinds of anxieties and stress which results in mental and physical disorders. Even though in this country there is plenty of money and food, people can get into a situation where they never feel satisfied. In reality, all who live in this way have succumbed to the devil�s temptation and are under his power.

How did Jesus answer the devil? Look at verse 4. �Jesus answered, �It is written: �Man does not live on bread alone.� Though Jesus is God, he spoke as a man under the authority of the word of God by simply quoting Scripture from Dt 8:3. The word of God was Jesus� powerful weapon in dealing with the devil�s temptation. �Man does not live on bread alone.� This is God�s truth that man is not just a physical being, but a spiritual being, made in the image of God. God made man body and soul as a being who is in relationship with God. More than anything else, we need God, and we need the word of God. Last night I was thinking about the particular worries we are each facing as a ministry, some of us are need funding, others need better jobs or promotion, others need to pay off debt, I think all of us would like perhaps just a little more money for future security or for a better quality of life, just a bit more space or some nicer clothes. Like bread, none of these things are bad, and some are really necessary, yet it is a question of priority and it goes to the heart of what we are living for. If we allow the desire of bread to come before our desire for God, our desire to live for Jesus and take up our cross whole heartedly, then gradually we can let the devil tempt us, we lose spirit, suffer a sense of loss, become double minded, begin to doubt God�s love and faithfulness to provide. We begin to look for something other than the flesh and blood of Jesus to satisfy our souls. Jesus said in Matthew 4:4, �Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.� Jesus always remembered that it is God who provides us and sustains our life. He firmly held on the word of God, obeyed him and lived his life of mission. 

Second, worship God only (5-8). Look at verse 5-7, �The devil led him to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And he said to him, �I will give you all their authority and splendour, for it is has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. So if you worship me it will be yours,� The devil did not give up easily. He kept coming with his baited hook with a second temptation. The devil showed Jesus a powerful image of all the kingdoms of the world in an instant. We can only imagine what flashed before Jesus, but we can be sure it was the most alluring, powerful and amazing image the devil could manage. Then the devil claimed that the world belonged to him and that he could give it to anyone he wanted. And he said, �So if you worship me, it will all be yours� (7).We must understand here that the devil is a liar (Jn 8:44). While it is true that he has some authority over the world, he boasted beyond the truth. He has some authority, but it is limited. Jesus called the devil, �the prince of this world� (Jn 12:31). The devil has authority over rebellious men (Eph 2:2) and fallen angels (Mt 25:41; Rev 12:9). Therefore, since God gave man the right to rule the world, the devil has some authority to rule the world through man. We see his power exercised when government officials act wickedly. Just look at Zimbabwe or North Korea or even in a lesser extent, MPs with their expenses. However, fundamentally, the earth is the Lord�s (Ex 9:29; Ps 24:1; 1 Cor 10:26). God alone is almighty. The time is coming when the devil will be thrown into the lake of burning sulphur to be tormented day and night forever (Rev 20:10). Though this devil makes big promises, saying, �it will all be yours,� he cannot keep them. He wants to be worshiped in the place of God. But what he delivers in return is misery, ruin and eternal judgment. 

Nevertheless, there was appeal in this temptation. It is, in fact, a temptation to compromise. As we know, Jesus had come to establish God�s kingdom by rescuing men from the power of the devil. To do so meant going to the cross. It was the most painful way. The devil was proposing that Jesus take an easier way. The devil would yield his claim to the world if Jesus just worshiped him. The devil made it sound painless. He did not even say �don�t worship God�, he just said �worship me as well�. But it was utter deception. If Jesus bowed to the devil, he would have lost everything. There have been many people who have fallen into this temptation to compromise. They want to do something good, but they realise it requires power. So they reason that the ends justify the means and compromise their integrity to get a position of power. However, then they lose the ability to do good. The early Christians had no earthly power in the beginning. Their only clout was prayer and the word of God. They lived pure and humble lives, sometimes in holes in the ground, or in caves. They loved Jesus wholeheartedly and did their best to witness to Jesus. Christian faith spread rapidly throughout the whole Roman Empire. Then Constantine recognized Christianity as the state religion of Rome. Christians gained tremendous power in the Empire. Beautiful church buildings were constructed, subsidized by government funds. Those who were considered heretical became enemies of the state. Attendance at Sunday worship service was enforced by the sword. Yet the message of the cross began to be lost. Christianity lost its vitality. We should learn from this. There are many today who think the Christian church needs political power. But the work of God is never done through political power. The work of God is done through the way of the cross. 

How did Jesus answer the devil? Look at verse 8. �Jesus answered, �It is written: �Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.��� Once again Jesus quoted the word of God from Deuteronomy chapter 6. Jesus summarized the most fundamental and basic teaching in the Bible about man�s duty to God. It is to worship God alone with all one�s heart, soul, mind and strength. It is to accept God�s sovereignty, and to believe his love and goodness, and to commit oneself to obedience and service to him without compromise, wherever he may lead. Jesus knew that this meant taking up his cross and shedding his blood for the sins of the world. But Jesus was willing to do so. In verse 8, Jesus proclaimed that God was worthy of his life sacrifice. Jesus was willing to give everything to God without reservation or calculation or hesitation. In this way Jesus overcame the devil�s temptation to compromise.

Look at verses 9. �The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. �If you are the Son of God,� he said, �throw yourself down from here.� This time the devil took Jesus to the highest point of the temple and tempted Jesus to throw himself from there like Super Man. This time like Jesus he also quoted the word of God from Ps 91. Look at verses 10-11. For it is written: ��He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.� The devil tempted Jesus to throw himself down because God promised to guard him. However, this was out of context. The theme of Psalm 91 is that when we follow God faithfully and trust in him he protect us, It does not tells us to test God. Always it is important to understand the word of God in context. How did Jesus overcome the temptation this time? Look at verse 12. Jesus answered, �It is said: �Do not put the Lord your God to the test.� �Testing God.�  is demanding God to prove his character or faithfulness. There are many people who test God. They try to force God to keep his promise immediately, according to their demand. Some demand healing. Others demand money from heaven. Some students demand an A on their exam, even though they wasted all of their study time uselessly. Instead of humbly standing under the authority of God�s word, they want to command God to do what they want. This time also Jesus overcame devil�s temptation by holding on God�s word. He did not put God to the test because he did not need to, he firmly believed that God would protect and guide him.

Look at verse 13. �When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.� The devil had done his best to get Jesus to disobey God�s word. But he failed. The time allowed for tempting passed and Jesus won the victory. There would be further encounters in the future. But Jesus would win the final victory over them all. 

In this passage we learn that Jesus defeated the devil�s temptation by standing on the absolute word of God: �It is written.� Jesus won this victory as our champion. Jesus shares his victory with us when we ask him in prayer. By ourselves, we have no strength to defeat the devil�s temptations but Jesus gives us the victory when we depend on him. Hebrews 4:15,16 says, �For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are�yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.� Let�s come to Jesus and ask him to share his victory with us.
