2011 Luke 33

PUT THIS MONEY TO WORK

Luke 19:11-27
Key verse 19:13
So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. �Put this money to work,� he said, �until I come back.

Today we are living between Jesus first coming and his return. Jesus is not here but he is coming back. Until then, how should we live? Luke is dealing with a series of teaching on the coming Kingdom of God. Jesus is heading towards Jerusalem and there was a sense of expectation � the king is coming; the king is coming. Many thought that the kingdom of God would appear at once. Today many believers want the kingdom to appear at once and all the problems to go away. In response to this view Jesus gives the parable of the 10 minas. Jesus wants to correct our view of the coming Kingdom and for us to have the right attitude towards our lives. In short we are to �put this money to work until Jesus comes back�. 

I. He was made king however

Look at verse 11: �While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.� As we saw last week Jesus was in Jericho and had visited the house of the chief tax collector. Amazingly he changed and radically altered the direction of his life. The blind received sight. There was a sense of excitement and hope. People felt that the kingdom of God was coming and that Jesus would bring God�s kingdom at once. They imagined Jesus walking into Jerusalem and entering the palace and claiming David�s throne. But there was a problem with such an expectation. Before all this Jesus would have to suffer, die on the cross and be raised again. More than this there would be a long wait before God�s kingdom would be established in full. The disciples themselves had the wrong view and even after Jesus resurrection asked if Jesus was at that time going to restore the kingdom to Israel (Acts 1:6). They had the wrong view on the Kingdom of God and to help Jesus told them this parable of the ten minas. To us it sounds fiction but to the people listening this was not just a story but recent history.

Look at verse 12: �A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.� In verse 14-15a Jesus tells is �But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, �We don�t want this man to be our king. He was made king, however, and returned home. � Although to us this is just a story to the people listening this was very real and part of recent Jewish history. Thirty years before this story, the cruel son of a cruel king went to Rome in order to be proclaimed king. He was called Archelaus and was the son of Herod the Great. He was so unpopular that a group of Jewish leaders followed him to Rome and argued for him not to be made king.  And it�s clear to see why. Before he left to see Augustus he had killed about 3000 Pharisees as part of his efforts to control the area. He had his palace in Jericho and the people hated him. In a way the delegation was successful because Augustus, instead of crowning him King, gave him the title of ethnarch rather than king. Yet although the name was different in effect he was king and ruler of the area. He was tetrarch of Judea and reigned as ethnarch from BC 4 until 6 AD. We read about Archelaus in Matthew 2:22 and how that when Joseph heard Archelaus was reigning in Judea he was afraid and took Mary and Jesus and went back to Galilee rather than Judea. So Jesus� early life had been directly touched by this cruel ruler. The people heard this story and would have said, �I know how that story goes and I know exactly the man you�re talking about.�  

But Jesus, of course, isn�t ultimately talking about Archelaus.  He�s talking about himself.  But he speaks of his rejection and how the one to be made king would go away on a long journey rather than be proclaimed king at once. By telling this parable, Jesus emphasized one thing: Jesus would become king in spite of fierce opposition. Although there is opposition and delay Jesus is king. As verse 15 makes clear �he was made king, however�. In the same way God exalted Jesus �to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow�. Every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Php 2:9-11). All people on earth will acknowledge Jesus as King. We do not vote for Jesus but he is king. In the distant land of heaven, God made Jesus King of kings and Lord of lords by his absolute sovereignty. Jesus� reign will be fully realized when he returns in great power and glory. But that will be a long time. So how should we live now? How does the king deal with his servants while he is away?

Look at verse 13: �So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. �Put this money to work,� he said, �until I come back��. The king called ten of his servants and gave each one a mina and told them �put this money to work until I come back�. A mina was about 3 month�s wages, about 100 drachmas. The average annual salary in the UK is about �24,000 so 3 months wages, or a mina, is today equivalent to about �6000.  Reasonably large but not enough on which to retire or do that much with. But to each he gives a mina and each has the freedom to use it according to their creativity and wisdom. He did not let his servants wander around doing nothing or spending their lives meaninglessly. Rather he gave them a clear direction, �put this money to work until I come back.�

What did the first and the second servants report? Look at verse 16: �The first one came and said, �Sir, your mina has earned ten more.� Wow! This is impressive! What kind of business can go from �6000 to �60,000? What could you do with six thousand pounds? You could not even open a small sandwich shop with that money. Maybe he bought a secondhand van and sold hotdogs or ice cream on the street. Whatever he did he did such great business that he made 10 times as much. Great investment! What did the second servant report? In verse 18 he reports �Sir, your mina has earned five more.� He made 5 times as much - about �30,000.  Again a good return. May be he had less opportunity or ability but nonetheless he made a great return.  

How did the master respond to his faithful servants? Look at verse 17: �Well done, my good servant!� his master replied. �Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.� In verse 19 the master said �You take charge of five cities.� So having taken charge of about �6000 and made �60,000 he now says �take charge of 10 cities.� The rewards are way out of proportion to the money. Yes to earn �60,000 is impressive but to be given 10 cities is way out of proportion! It�s very generous. London has about 8 million people and so 10 cities would be to be in charge of 80 million people. It�s as if I swept the streets on Archway high street for a week and was suddenly made Mayor of London. Taking charge of one city is of course incomparable to a mina. The master granted them an unimaginable and generous reward.

What is the basis of this incredible reward? Look again at verse 17: �Well done, my good servant! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter take charge of ten cities.� He complemented his servant calling him, �good servant.� Notice what he commended him about? Did he say: �Well done - you are a great businessman? Well done - your investment strategy was brilliant! Well done for turning �6000 into �60,000! I�m very pleased with the money.� No. He said, �You have been trustworthy in a very small matter.� The master was now king of the country. He had more than enough wealth and did not actually care about the money his servants earned. But he did care about whether they were trustworthy with very little or not.

The truth is that most people prefer to take charge of big or large or prestigious matters. We like things with status, recognition and reward. When given lowly invisible jobs to do at work people feel put upon and slighted. If asked to do lowly things in the ministry we can feel neglected. It is very difficult to be faithful with very small matters. When thinking of the great profits made by the first servant, we can guess that he was a very talented and competent man. He could have grumbled that his master did not give him special treatment but was only entrusted with the same amount of money as the others. However, he did not complain but worked faithfully. He worked hard with what he had. And when he was trusted with very little the master noticed and rewarded him with incredible blessing.

This is God�s way. 1 Corinthians 4:2 says, �Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.� 2 Timothy 2:2 says, �And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.� God wants faithful men. David was a faithful shepherd when he tended to his father�s sheep. He risked his own life and fought against bears or lions in defending these small animals. He was faithful even to sheep that he has been entrusted with. God saw his faithfulness and entrusted him with the people of Judah and later the whole of Israel. Likewise Joseph was unfairly treated and sold into slavery yet he served Potiphar and then the prison guards. He was made prime minister of Egypt. Some people want to do great things for God yet they neglect the importance of small things. Dreams of big ministries, big crowds, national movements and so on sound good! People can think that they would be faithful if only God would only give big things or what they want. But Jesus tells us that it does not work like this. Those who neglect small matters or neglect what we have been given cannot be faithful to big things. Thus, God uses those who are faithful with small things and with what we are given. If we faithfully serve one person God sends more. Where there is life things grow and more is added but God looks to see what our attitude is to the very small things. 

I�ve come to think what are our minas? Broadly speaking, it is the opportunities that God gives. Some think of it as our talents � it is not so much talents as opportunities. In life Christ gives us opportunities to serve him as he brings people and opportunities to us in various ways. On our part, we must decide to put his grace to work and serve faithfully in the very small things that he brings. But the problem is the opportunities are often very small. As God said to Zechariah it�s easy to despise the day of small things. It�s easy not to notice them. It�s easy to neglect them. I have been reminded of the Apostle Paul�s encouragement to the Ephesians: �Be very careful, then, how you live�not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.� (Eph 5:15-16). The Apostle Paul knew how to invest his life to the glory of God. Be mindful  of the very small things.

Let�s come back to the parable. How did the third servant respond? Look at verse 20: �Then another servant came and said, �Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.� This is the report of the third servant. He did not make a profit with the mina but instead laid it away in a piece of cloth. Another translation says �laid away in a handkerchief�. He wrapped it up and did not do anything with what he had been given. His excuse is in verse 21: �I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.� 

He said that his master was a hard man. A hard man is a man who is merciless and ruthless who only wants to achieve what he desires. Was his master that kind of man? Not at all. He was concerned about his servants and was incredibly generous to them. He wanted his servants to improve and grow in their abilities. He wanted to reward them amazingly. He was utterly generous on his return. It seems that this man had an ugly and wrong view of the master. So how did the master respond? Verse 22-23: �He said to him, 'I will condemn you with your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?'� 

He does not argue with the man�s assessment but responed ironically.  He�s not accepting the judgment of the wicked servant.   He�s saying, �Really?  You knew did you that I am a severe man?  OK, if I�m a severe man and I�m working for me, I�m at least putting that money in the bank to earn interest�. Jesus knows that everybody in the crowd will look at that one servant and say, �You fool!�  The servant acted irresponsibly and irrationally in doing what he did and blaming it on the hardness and severity of this king. 
 
So what�s the point? It�s a tough point. We see here that sometimes sin is not doing anything at all. You can be so paralysed by fear of failure or fatalism or laziness and do nothing. But doing nothing at all can be sin. This man took the money wrapped it in a cloth and handed it back at the end. Jesus question is hard. Jesus is essentially asking �what have done with your Christian life and faith?� Some live their Christians lives hidden away in a piece of cloth. �Well, I go to church sometimes.� Hidden away in a piece of cloth. �Well I don�t really do much. I'm not involved with other believers.� Hidden away in a piece of cloth. �I am a believer but I'm not learning and growing, I'm not regularly reading my bible�. Hidden away in a piece of cloth. Maybe it even sounds spiritual. �Well, I don't believe in organized religion.� Or, �you know, it's a personal relationship between me and Jesus. It doesn't need to involve other people.� Whatever the excuse it�s life hidden away in a piece of cloth.

Second thing that this servant teaches is the principle. Jesus is not rebuking him because he did not make a fortune. This parable is not teaching us that we have to go out and become super successful spiritual businessmen: �Unless you get a large mega church and get lots of bible students then it�s the scrap heap for you�. No. The master drew a distinction between hiding the coin to give it back and putting it on deposit. The main difference is not the interest the mina could have earned, but the principle. We know the master does not need the money. But by hiding the mina, the servant treated the mina as his own property. He hid and saved it for himself and to save himself from his master�s rebuke. If instead he had put the money on deposit, he would have acknowledged that the coin was not his, but his masters. As any banker will tell you, putting money on deposit means there is more money available for entrepreneurs to put it to work as needed. In short, hiding money is the worst thing you can do for a developing economy, and it is likewise the worst thing one can do with God�s gift of grace. Holding on to God�s grace for oneself without sharing it with others is a sin. It is for this reason that Jesus rebuked the lame man at the pool of Bethesda who had been healed but did not testify about Jesus� grace to the Pharisees: �See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.� (Jn. 5:14). 

Likewise, those people in Jericho who begrudged Jesus� healing of the blind man and forgiveness of Zacchaeus the tax collector were sinning by suppressing God�s gift of grace. It is a sin to hide our talents and gifts to spare ourselves. It is a sin to treat God�s grace and mercy to us as though it were owed to us, and the obligation of using it were a burden to get out from under.  Some treat ministry as a burden. This is a tough warning. 

How did the master punish the lazy servant? Look at verses 24 to 25: �Then he said to those standing by, �Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.� �Sir,� they said, �he already has ten!�� The other servants were surprised that the master gave the coin from the wicked servant to the one who already had ten. It didn�t seem fair. He didn�t need it! That is true. He already had enough. But he wasn�t given more because he needed more. He was given more because he knew how to use what was given him and because the master, rather than a hard man, was generous. Look at verse 26: �He replied, �I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.�� In this verse, we can find a wonderful promise of God. Those who have the grace and mercy of God in their hearts will receive more and more. The more they share it with others, the more it will fill their own hearts. King David expressed this in Psalm 23: �You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.� David? Who was he? He was a sinner. At times a wicked man � an adulterer and murderer. But his life was marked, not by judgment or sin, but by God�s grace to him, which then poured out from him onto many of his countrymen. On the other hand, those who take God�s grace for granted, trying to save it selfishly for themselves will lose everything. And as verse 27 makes clear those who reject that grace outright will only face God�s wrath.

In this parable the master represents Jesus who is king. Jesus is very generous but we should not misunderstand � he is king. He will come with glory in the future. He will come with authority and power to judge the world. Jesus does not need our money. He may not have given us a huge amount but he is not looking for huge profits. Rather he looks to see what we have done with the grace that he has given. Have we been faithful with the very little things? Have we kept them to ourselves? Have we hidden our lives away in a piece of cloth? 

There are only three outcomes. Jesus will bless the faithful servants abundantly; he will punish the wicked servants ruthlessly and will also destroy all the enemies who opposed him becoming king. With this in mind we should not waste our lives or take the grace of God for granted but make the most of every opportunity. If you are doing well then fine, carry on. But if not perhaps this message is a bit tough. The question is then what changes do you need to make? What changes do you need to make with your time, with your talent, with your treasure? Jesus is incredibly generous and wants to bless his servants with great reward. When we remember the generosity of Jesus we can invest freely and confidently for his glory. May God help us not to squander our lives but put his grace to work.
