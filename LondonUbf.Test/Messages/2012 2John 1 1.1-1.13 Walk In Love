WALK IN LOVE

2 John 1:1-13
Key verse 1:6
“And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.”

2 John is a brief letter to encourage a church under threat of spiritual attack. John was writing to encourage the believers in their struggle to remain in Jesus. Just like today there were many attacks on the church in John’s time. We have heard about the Gnostics and the Judaisers and in our own time the church faces attacks from liberals and groups like the Jehovah’s Witnesses who pervert the truth of the Bible. John tells us that attackers are either adding to or taking away from Jesus and either way they are antichrists. The danger, John tells us, is that we may be fooled and lose our reward. This is a great danger, how can we resist it and defend ourselves against it? The answer is truth and love, for a church to be strong and resist spiritual attack both the truth and love of God must be strong. When we have a clear understanding of the truth and share it with one another and other people in love, then we are strong in Jesus and can resist the attacks of the world. 
Look at verse 1; ‘The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth— and not I only, but also all who know the truth—.’ John introduces himself as the elder. The elder is an affectionate term, showing that John loves this church and is loved by it. His letter is therefore a letter of love and concern for a group of people he sincerely loves. He is writing to ‘the chosen lady’ which would either have been a particular woman or a way of addressing a church community. Which it is does not matter a great deal, the messages of this letter can be equally well addressed to a family or a church. Let’s consider John’s advice as that of a loving elder to a church community. 
In this first verse John also talks about love and truth. Love and truth are central to what John has to say to the recipients of his letter. Love and truth represent the spirit in which John writes. He wishes to reassure a community of people who have been under a spiritual attack. The tone of his letter is that of a shepherd. It seems that John is the man who brought them to faith, who still has deep affection for them and wishes to see them continue to grow. There is a sense of danger though. There are people sowing doubt amongst Christians and John wants to say to them, ‘I was the one who brought you to faith, I am writing to reassure you, listen to my teaching and trust in Jesus.’
Look at verse 2; ‘because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us for ever:’ There is only one source of truth and that is God and John says that the truth lives in us and will be with us forever. Jesus said; ‘I am the way and the truth and the life (John 14:6).’ Jesus has made his home in those who believe (John 14:23) forever. When something goes wrong in our faith we can feel completely defeated. However just because someone has unsettled us does not mean that we have lost the truth, in fact Jesus is eternal and when we meet him we gain eternal life. This gives us a sense of perspective. Those who have met Jesus personally do not need to worry about losing him or their salvation because once we have met him we are guaranteed eternal life. When we meet and love Jesus he promises that we have God and Jesus in our hearts for eternity. Consequently verse 3 tells us that; ‘Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son’, will be with us in truth and love.’ Everyone desires grace, mercy and peace and true grace, mercy and peace come only from God and Jesus. The people to whom John was writing had a relationship with Jesus and therefore they could be reassured and experience grace, peace and mercy. 
Truth and love are at the heart of our faith. We cannot have one without the other. Truth alone can be harsh and easily hurts people. Love without truth is too gentle and does not challenge. There is a story of a man who shook hands with his pastor one Sunday morning and he said to him, "Oh Pastor, I want to tell you what a blessing you've been to me since you've been pastor of this church. Why, when I first started here, I didn't have any regard for God, man or the devil. But since you came, I've learned to love all three." Love and truth often appear to be opposing each other yet we see that throughout the Bible they come together. 1 Corinthians 13 says; ‘Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.’ Jesus embodied truth and love. If we think about the way he treated the woman caught in adultery we see that he told her that she had sinned, he acknowledged that she deserved to be punished and then he forgave her and told her; ‘Go now and leave your life of sin.’ People need to know the truth. The truth is that sinful man deserves eternal punishment but that in love God sent his one and only son Jesus Christ to die on the cross so that those who believe in him might be forgiven and set free from sin and death. We must have this balance of truth and love in our own relationships with God and also in our relationships with one another. 
Look at verse 4. ‘It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.’ To walk in the truth means to remain close to Jesus and keep growing in him. People who walk in the truth have good spiritual habits like prayer, meditation on the word of God, Bible study and testimony sharing. Through these good habits they walk with Jesus and come to know and understand him more and more. John rejoiced that people in this church were coming to faith. This is the heart of a Bible teacher and shepherd. Imagine emailing Moses to tell him that a student has met Jesus personally through us, he would be very encouraged and would write back joyfully. John was very encouraged because this meant that people who were condemned to hell and eternal punishment had received eternal life in Jesus. Salvation is just the beginning of our lives of faith though, if we really love someone we need to encourage them to keep on walking in the truth. We also need to keep on walking in the truth ourselves so that we continue to grow in Jesus. 
By this time John has laid the foundation of his letter. He has reassured the church. He has reminded them of the importance of truth and love and he has celebrated the growth of the church. Now he discusses love in greater depth. Look at verses 5 and 6; ‘And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another. And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.’ 
First John says ‘I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning.’  His response to a threat is not new teaching but to return to the fundamentals of the faith. Bible students often ask why the Old Testament is so full of judgement and the New Testament is so full of love. They see a contradiction between the two because they do not know either well enough to judge. But love is the central theme of the Bible throughout. Jesus said; ‘'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.’ In these words Jesus sums up the whole Bible, in fact what he says is a quotation of Deuteronomy (6:5) and Leviticus (19:18). So we can see that the theme of love spreads right through the Bible. God showed his love when he gave Adam and Eve the Garden of Eden and he continued to show his love throughout the Bible from the time they fell into sin and he covered them in animal skins right the way through to the time that he sent Jesus to die on the cross. 
Love therefore is the heart of our relationship to God and must be at the heart of a strong church community. A loving Christian community is an illustration of God’s love for sinful man and therefore a great form of evangelism. When people see a loving spiritual community they see God’s love and they are attracted to it. Love is also a great defence against spiritual attack. In verse 6 John says; ‘And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.’ He tells the church that they have to walk in love. Then he says that love is expressed by obeying Jesus’ commands and then that Jesus’ command is that we walk in love. This appears to go around in a circle but if we look at John 13 (34-35) we see one of the final things Jesus said to his disciples before he went to the cross was; ‘A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.’ Jesus commanded us to love one another. Just as the Bible is consistently about God’s love it is also consistently about our love for God and one another. 
Many people find the notion of love and command contradictory because we think of love as a feeling. But Jesus wants us to make a decision to love because he loved us. Others will know that he loves them when they see us love one another and love those he sends to us. This is very beautiful and very difficult because people are not naturally loving. Therefore we have to make a decision to love others. To love means to give of ourselves and put other people first. We may respond to this dutifully by saying; ‘OK, I am a Christian, I suppose I have to do this.’ But a dutiful heart is not a heart of love. A dutiful heart is selfish and obeys because we have to for our own benefit. Everyone in the world obeys in this way. We obey policemen and bosses, the local council, parents and parking wardens. We obey through a variety of motivations; habit, laziness, fear or simply because we know it is right. But if we are simply obeying Jesus because we have to it does not make us any different to anyone else. A loving heart though is focused on others and gladly serves other people because it wants the best for them. Therefore we not only have to love others, we have to gladly love others and enjoy loving others. 
I am good at being dutiful and following instructions, at least when people are watching. When I think no one is watching then I can be a bit more rebellious and do things my own way. In work I do what my boss wants so long as I think she can see what I am doing, as soon as I think her back is turned, I quietly do things my own way. With Jesus I am often the same. I act like a loving Christian, Bible teacher during Bible studies when I think Jesus is watching and when no one is around I can be bad tempered, argumentative or sullen. Often I am serving dutifully not through love thinking that Jesus cannot see. Recently though God has shown me the weakness of my attitude to obedience. Now I have nowhere to hide from other people. At home I have Simon, in the car on the way to work I have a colleague, my wife works in the same place as I do and recently a colleague challenged me about my bad temper in work. There is no place I can go where I can get away with my attitude of conditional love. Spiritually, I am never away from Jesus therefore I either have to learn to be dutiful at all times or I need to make a decision to love as Jesus loved me. I need to learn to gladly love other people, I need to learn to love loving other people. The model of love I need to follow is Jesus’ love. This is totally unconditional. Jesus loved me so much that he willingly went to the cross for my sins. Jesus did not enjoy doing this; he did not do it grudgingly because his dad said he had to. Jesus said; ‘Greater love has no-one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends (John 15:13).’ He died on the cross gladly because he knew that through it he would save me.
The problem with following this example is that I do not have the power to love sacrificially as Jesus did. The key to loving in this way is truth. We learned in 1 John that; ‘we love because he first loved us’ (1 John 4:19). This is the truth; that we were lost sinners who Jesus came and saved in love. When we accept the truth about; who we were and what we deserved, we come to have a great sense of gratitude for the grace we have received. Then we are glad, joyful and empowered to love others. Remember what John Newton wrote in Amazing Grace; ‘amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me, I once was lost but now am found, was blind but now I see.’ When Jesus was anointed by a sinful woman he said (Luke 7:47); ‘…her many sins have been forgiven— for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.’ The less sense we have of our sin, the less we have of the love of God who saved us from it. My sullenness and bad temper are rooted in pride and self-righteousness which tell me that I have not done much wrong and therefore do not need much salvation. People who really love are like Paul, they know that they are the worst of sinners and are free only by the grace of God. Therefore I need to make a decision to return to the truth of I who I really am before God and love with the love he has shown me. When, as Christians and as a Christian community we live in love and truth, then we are strengthened in the power of Jesus Christ.
The second half of John’s letter focuses on the attacks of those outside the church. These are rooted in two main heresies. The first are those people who wish us to believe that Jesus is less than the Bible tells us and the second is those people who tell us that we need to add something to the Bible to be saved. In our own time these are represented by liberal Christians and religious groups who look similar to churches but have false beliefs. In John’s time there was no written New Testament therefore he was defending the church against new and different ideas carried by travelling teachers who would come and sow doubt amongst congregations. Look at verse 7; ‘Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.’ That Jesus came into this world as God incarnate is central to the Christian faith. The Gnostics could not accept this as they believed that flesh is evil and only the spirit can be good. Instead they taught that Jesus was a man upon whom God’s spirit rested or that he was a false Messiah because he claimed to be God. In our own time many people enjoy Jesus’ teachings. They love to talk about loving your neighbour but they reject the idea that Jesus is God. This reduces Jesus from the all-powerful creator of the universe to a moral teacher like Gandhi or Confucius.  If this is all that Jesus is then he has no power to change our lives and, as Paul said; ‘we are to be pitied more than all men (1 Cor 15:9)’.  
Look at verse 8; ‘Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.’ Once we are born again we cannot lose our salvation however, John warns the believers not to fall into this trap and risk losing their reward in heaven. Our reward comes when we invest in the Kingdom of Heaven by loving those who Jesus sends us to love. For us that means teaching the Bible and raising people as disciples as well as investing in our own community. It means love and truth. If we lose a sense of who Jesus really is then we cannot do any of these things because we do not have the truth. Then we lose our reward. In Revelations (3:11) Jesus says; ‘Hold on to what you have, so that no-one will take your crown.’ Therefore we need to maintain a clear biblical understanding of who Jesus is by constantly walking with him in faith. 
Look at verse 9; ‘Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.’ The second heresy is that of adding to what the Bible says. Revelations 22:18 says; ‘I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.’ In John’s time this was the Judaisers who said that you could not be saved unless you were circumcised. In our time this is groups like the Mormons, the Moonies or the Jehovah’s Witnesses who tell us that the Bible is not enough and there are more things we need to do to be saved. The Moonies call themselves a church and believe many similar things to Christians. They read the Bible but they believe that Jesus failed to complete his salvation work because he died on the cross. Therefore they believe that the Reverend Moon has been called by God as a new Messiah to finish what Jesus failed to do. This completely denies the truth of who Jesus is and what he did for us on the cross, it means that these people do not have truth and that therefore they cannot show true love. 
The Bible is truth. Therefore adding to or taking from the Bible contradicts the truth and is not loving. Those who tell people they can be saved by believing that Jesus is anything other than the Son of God and those who tell people that they need to do special things which are not in the Bible are both ‘antichrists’. They are leading people astray and leading them to hell. What is the solution to the danger of people like this? Love and truth. As people of God we should know the truth and walk in love, then we can tell if anyone who comes to us is from God or not. This way we know if those people should be welcomed into our homes or resisted so that we do not support them in their wicked work. Therefore to be safe from spiritual attacks we need to continually walk with Jesus, growing in his truth and his love.
In conclusion. All churches and all Christians are in danger from spiritual attack. We cannot lose our salvation but we can lose our reward therefore we must guard ourselves by walking with Jesus in truth and love. I pray that this might be a loving spiritual community growing in Jesus so that we can resist untruth and be a blessing to many. Amen
