YOU ALSO MAY HAVE FELLOWSHIP

1John 1:1-10
Key verse 1:3
"We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ."

We begin our studies in 1 John and are moving from the teachings of the Apostle Paul in Ephesians to those of John. John writes in a very different way to Paul and as we start it can helpful to remember the different emphasis and ministry of the various authors. The ministries of John, Peter and Paul each had their different tasks and emphasis. Watchman Nee suggests these 3 men’s ministries can be characterized by the tasks that each man was doing when they were first called by Jesus. So Peter for example when called was a fisherman and called when casting a net into the sea. As such Peter's ministry can be characterized as beginning things, initiating new programs and casting out for new people such as the early accounts in Acts. In contrast when called, the Apostle Paul was a tent maker. As such he built things and his ministry as someone who laid the foundations and began to build the church. But John is very different to both of these. When he was first called by Jesus he was mending his nets. John is a mender. It seems his writings are much later than the others and were written when error and apostasy had begun to creep in. He wrote when there was a need to call people back to the original foundations. When we begin to drift its John who brings us back and sets things straight. In many ways this is the letter of first John and it can be helpful to remember as we study this book that John is a mender. By way of background many believe that this is one of the last letters of the New Testament and written around 90-95AD or even as late as 100 A.D. John lived under the reign of the Roman Emperor Domitian, according to the early church father Eusebius, was even crueler than the infamous Nero. The church was under great attack not only from the violence of the Roman Empire but the subtle and more dangerous inner attacks of Gnosticism. The theme of 1 John can be characterized as articulating authentic Christianity. What is a Christian? John’s emphasis is that a Christian has genuine fellowship with the triune God. I pray God may bless our study and we may grow in fellowship with Him as we come to this great book. 

Look at verse 1. “That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched— this we proclaim concerning the Word of life.” Other than Hebrews, John’s letters are the only ones that do not start with an opening salutation. He gets straight down to business. What is Christianity? In short it’s a person. It’s not a system of thought or special knowledge but a revealed person. John says ‘that which was from the beginning i.e. Jesus is someone he heard, saw, and touched – this he proclaims. He basically says, “Look, I knew Jesus.” I touched Him. I saw Him. I heard Him. I knew who He was; I know who He is; I know what He taught; and I’m reinforcing that with you today. John is responding to the Gnostic claims of the need for special knowledge or revelation. He is saying that the Christian faith is not man’s speculations about God but rather God has chosen to reveal himself to man. John is saying that he experienced Jesus and it’s a historical fact. It is not someone’s subjective idea about God but rather it is that God himself has chosen to reveal himself to man and this is rooted in history.

But this is more than just a person. Look at verse 2. “The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us.” The life appeared and we proclaim it. John is straining language here to contain the enormity of what he wants to tell us but in short he is saying ‘the life appeared’. The eternal life that was with the Father appeared in human history as a person. That which was from the beginning, that life itself that was with God the father, has come to be with man and he is going to tell us about this life.

What is the point he wants to make here? It is that the word of life they experienced is not a philosophical theory or an abstract idea. Rather that he is a living person and a God whom they had fellowship with. But perhaps the most amazing thing is John wants to proclaim is that we can have fellowship with this God. This is not just some interesting curiosity from history but John proclaims this because we also can have fellowship with God. 

Look at verse 3. “We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.” Notice first that this must be proclaimed: ‘we proclaim to you’. The Gnostic claim was that the truth about Christ was some deep mystery or secret known only by a few. John counters that error by showing the true Christianity is not exclusive and rather it is a message that must be proclaimed. Why does John proclaim this? It’s not just general interest but because in proclaiming the truth about Jesus we also enter into the same fellowship with God that these apostles enjoyed. The amazing news in verse 3 is that you and I ‘may also have fellowship’ with God as the apostle John does. Fellowship means literally ‘to share in common’. It is to share life together. It is to have communion and communication with God. In Greek the word ‘fellowship’ is the word koinonia and conveys community, communion, sharing and intimacy. It is for this reason that Jesus came into the world to bring eternal life. This is not just living eternally but as Jesus says " eternal life (is) that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent" (Jn 17:3). Eternal life is to know God and Jesus personally – it is fellowship with God. That is an enormous claim. 

How can we know if we have this fellowship? As verse 4 says "we write this to make our joy complete" or as another translation says ‘make your joy complete’. Fellowship with Christ should be characterised by complete joy. When we have fellowship with Jesus there should be joy, a life of richness, quiet excitement, a life free from boredom and emptiness.

As I say this is a huge claim and these past weeks this passage has caused me to wonder about my fellowship with God. On first studying the bible I became convinced about the identity and truth of Jesus and thought ‘OK its true’. But I was then amazed when Jesus says that ‘if anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him and we will, make our home with him.’ (Jn 14:23). The thought that the living God would make his home in me blew my mind! This is a mysterious union of God and man. We saw it in Ephesians when Paul talks of the deposit of the Spirit and, of the eyes of our hearts being enlightened (Eph 1:13,18). Here John challenges by asking whether there is real fellowship and communion with God?  The implied question is how is your fellowship? How is your personal fellowship with Jesus? Although we may be growing in our theology or doctrine or ministry, the real issue is how is fellowship and joy with God? This is not just a relationship but rather intimate communion with Him. There is a big difference between a relationship and a fellowship. For example imagine a newborn baby born into a family. There is new life and a new relationship but there is no fellowship with a baby in that the baby just receives and knows almost nothing. It’s only as the child grows does it comes to understand more of how his parents love and care for him and the fellowship increases. I remember the frustration of my children not being able to speak English. I felt distant from them whereas Joanna was closer because when they were very young they could speak fluent Korean. Likewise fellowship with God through Christ is not automatic or effortless. Fellowship takes time and effort. For example there is no such thing as a good marriage that just happens spontaneously. You see a good marriage, because the couple make it a priority to spend time together and work at being close. They are committed to work through any difficulties or hurt feelings. They work hard at communication and try and avoid temptations that create distance or divide them. Yet even in marriage although couples may be married there can be days, weeks or sometimes months, even years, without real close communication and intimacy. They remain in a relationship but the fellowship can be distant. Perhaps with the busyness of life, pressures of work and young children and so on couples can live side-by-side without much real intimacy. In the same way we can miss out on fellowship that God wants to bring. Fellowship with God is no different to marriage in that you've got to work at it, make time for it and turn away from other things that would create distance between you and God. This is mysterious and there is not a simple, ‘Do A,B,C and you also may have fellowship with God’ but nonetheless it takes work. On Friday Darren pointed out to me that in the teaching of children it’s entirely God’s work to change them but he pointed out that as with the changing of water to wine (Jn 2) although God does the work we have to fill them with teaching as filling the jar to the brim. In the same way in developing fellowship with God the work of prayer, bible study, meditation and time are vital steps we take as part of working towards fellowship. 

But notice that this is not just a personal struggle. As verse 3 says "We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us.” Christianity cannot be learnt by theology alone or through only a solitary pursuit. There should be fellowship with us i.e. between believers. Today some people say that they are looking for God without the church or have a personal relationship with God without the church. Of course faith is personal and church membership alone without faith means nothing, but John is clear that you cannot separate fellowship with God from fellowship with one another. You also may have fellowship.

Having said ‘you also may have fellowship’ John goes on to describe a key characteristic of whom we have fellowship with. Look at verse 5. “This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all.” First John puts it in the positive that God is light and then in the negative in him there is no darkness at all. What does it mean ‘God is light?’ It means that in some ways God is like light.

The most obvious characteristic about light is that it reveals things, it shows us things. Ray Steadman has rather scary account of how when young he was driving to California and picked up two young hitchhikers. They decided to take a detour to see the Grand Canyon. The journey was longer than they thought they arrived long after midnight and not knowing where to go and drove into a forest park the car and slept in sleeping bags not far from the car. He woke up in the morning the sun was up to his amazement he was just an arm’s length from the edge of the canyon. If he had rolled over in his sleep he would have fallen over a 500 foot drop into the Canyon. In the darkness they had not seen it but the light made it clear. In just the same way the light of God enables us to see things that we would never otherwise see. Jesus reveals the reality and opens the eyes of our heart so that life becomes more clear and in focus. I remember when young, when at university wondering, why am I here? What is the purpose of my life? What should they do after university? I never found an answer and just thought this was the reality of life. Yet when I met Jesus I gradually found that I knew the purpose of my life, I could see where I was going and see who I was. Often this is a gradual process rather than something that happens all at once but regardless of time, fellowship with God shows itself in being able to see life more clearly. Some believes struggle with what to do. They say things like: Where do I go next? What job? What marriage? What mission do I take and so on and so on? Yet very often the problem is not who, what or where but an absence of light and a lack of fellowship.

The second quality of light is it is straight. If you see a carpenter lifting up a beam of wood to look along it they are checking to see whether the wood is straight by holding up to the light. In the same way we can check the truth of ideas and plans against God's perfect light. As Proverbs says your word is a lamp to my feet. The light shines and reveals the straight way ahead.

Third light energizes and gives life. I have a very small back garden which should have some grass in it but is basically a lump of mud. I’ve put down grass seed, new turf, fertilizer, water – the result? Nothing. The mud remains.  Because basically there is not enough light for grass to grow. Light makes things grow. 

Likewise John is saying that God is light and therefore fellowship with God should be characterized by this light. Such people are able to see where they are going, reveal truth, are brighter, energetic and life giving. You may so OK ‘I see that but let’s face it why are Christians not more like this?’ It’s a good question. Sad to say there are many low voltage Christians. I do not have much time but John sees three ways that Christians miss out on fellowship. Three times he uses the phrase, “If we claim”: Verse 6, "If we claim to have fellowship," verse 8, "If we claim to be without sin," and verse 10, "If we claim we have not sinned." Three times a profession is indicated, but the condition or possession that follows is not there. In short people claim fellowship but there is something missing. These are not just the Gnostic errors, although they include these, they can refer to errors that believers fall into and so damage the fellowship with God.

Look at verse 6. “If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth.” What is the problem here? Here John is dealing with those who profess a relationship with Jesus, perhaps for years, yet there is no sign of it in his life. The problem in verse 6 is he is “walking in darkness”. This is not necessarily a life of sin but rather to walk in darkness means to walk by turning God off. We may sin as a result of darkness but to walk in darkness is simply an absence of light. At night when you turn off the light darkness immediately comes flooding in. When we walk in darkness we then sin in various ways but the real problem is that we have turned off the light. There are obvious ways in which we can turn off the light; Stop coming to church. Stop reading the Bible. Stop praying. But there are far more subtle ways to walk in darkness. One way is simply not look at ourselves and examine our lives. An early example in the New Testament is that of Ananias and Sapphira who were judged for pretending to be what they were not. They pretended to have a holiness that they did not actually possess. They were probably believers but they lived as hypocrites and walked in darkness and lied about their offering to the Church and Peter (Acts 5). The answer as verse 7 says is to “walk in the light”. This does not mean living a perfect life but rather responding actively to the light that God shines. It is to live before God openly rather than dodging our sin, blaming others or hiding our lives. But rather than hide our sin John tells us of a great promise. Look at verse 7. “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.” As we walk in the light we immediately came to have a fellowship with one another. Sin causes relationships to become false, or strained or shallow. But when we are honest and come into the light fellowship is created. The promise that blood of Christ purifies us from all sin is what means anyone can have fellowship. Let me give you an example. John Wesley was once riding his horse, singing a favourite hymn, when a robber grabbed him and said “Your money or your life.”  Wesley obediently emptied his pockets but didn’t have much money. He invited the robber to go through his saddlebags, which were filled with books and the disappointed robber turned away. As he did Wesley called out, “Stop!  I have something more to give you.” The robber turned back and Wesley said, “My friend, you may live to regret this sort of life you’re living.  If you ever do, remember this, ‘the blood of Jesus Christ, God’s Son, cleanses from all sin.’”  The robber hurried away and Wesley prayed that the word spoken might be fixed in the robber’s conscience. Years later, at the close of a Sunday evening service, a man stepped forward and asked to speak with Wesley.  Wesley was surprised to learn that this was the man who had robbed him years before.  He was now a well-to-do businessman and amazingly a child of God.  God had used the words spoken that night in his conversion.  He took Wesley’s hand and kissed it and said with deep emotion, “To you, dear sir, I owe it all.”  Wesley replied: “Nay, nay, my friend not to me, but to the precious blood of Christ which cleanses us from all sin.” They were brought into true fellowship by Jesus. Even when walk in darkness there is hope in Jesus. We should feel guilty because of our sins but Jesus purifies us from all sin and opens up real fellowship with him and with one another.

The second error is in verse 8: “If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.” Notice that in verse 8 it’s written as “sin” and verse 9 is in plural referring to “sins”. Basically there are many kinds of sins but all have one root – sin. John is dealing with Gnostics that denied that we have a sinful nature and who say that because of Jesus, sin is gone. There are quotes that support this. Jesus said on the cross, ‘It is finished’. Paul tells us that we are a new creation in Christ Jesus and that the old has gone and the new has come – but this is to misread. The truth is that the sinful nature remains. It is not possible to live without sin. Today few believers would say that they are without sin but there have been times in church history when this happens. DL Moody had someone come up to him and say that he no longer sinned. Moody said “Well I’d like to ask your wife about that”.

The third error is not denial of sin but self deception. Look at verse 10. “If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.” This is similar to verse 8 but more subtle in that while they claim there is such a thing as sin they rationalise sin away and say they have not sinned themselves. 

Although we grow in the Christian life and we should increase in holiness this does not mean perfection. As Augustine said to Pelagius the church is not the place for perfect Christians but where sick sinners get well. How do we get well? How do we maintain fellowship with a holy God despite our sin? Look at verse 9 "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." There's a lot I could say but in short the word “confess” does not mean to ask for forgiveness. “Fess” comes from a root which means "to say" and “con” means "with". Therefore confesses is ‘to say with God’. Confession is to agree with God about what he says. The Holy Spirit convicts us of our sin and his light shines. If we do not confess and agree with the light, we immediately break fellowship. But if we confess he purifies us from all unrighteousness. 

In conclusion, everything that Jesus did here on earth, the reason why he came from the beginning was to bring us into fellowship with Him and the Father. This fellowship is offered to every believer. How do we get this? We have to accept the historical fact of Jesus as proclaimed in the bible; live in the light of God and confess our sins. If we confess our sins, God forgives and cleanses us from all unrighteousness. May God bless us to grow in true and joyful fellowship with Him!
