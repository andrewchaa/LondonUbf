2011 Luke 28


FAITH AS SMALL AS A MUSTARD SEED

Luke 17:1-19
Key verse 17:6
   �He replied, If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.�

In this passage, Jesus describes the inner character that his disciples should have. It teaches us what attitude we should have towards other believers and also what attitude we should have to God. May God help us to learn the faith of a mustard seed; that has the power to forgive and give thanks and do the impossible. May God help us to please him through this faith and grow as men and women of faith with a good spiritual influence. 

?. Warning and Forgiveness (1-10) 
Look at verse 1. Jesus begins with a strict warning. �Jesus said to his disciples: Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to that person through whom they come.�  First, Jesus says, �Things that cause people to sin are bound to come.� He is referring to temptation, it is the thing that causes us to sin and it is inevitable. But that doesn�t mean we should give in to temptation. Jesus was tempted and was without sin. Secondly, Jesus says, �but woe to that person through whom they come.� Temptation is bound to come but we should make sure we are not the ones through which it comes. Jesus is saying this to his disciples. Disciples are spiritual shepherds and leaders and as such their example matters because of the influence it has on others. Jesus says �woe� to warn that a disciple�s bad example can easily tempt others. Look at verse 2. �It would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.�
 One of the easiest sins which a spiritual leader can commit is to cause little ones to sin. A little one can mean just that, a child, one who is particularly susceptible to an elder�s influence, and it can also mean one who is young in the faith. When a shepherd doesn�t help a little one properly, he/she can cause them to sin and fall away. People with little faith can often initially rely on their spiritual elder more than God. An elder�s careless word or action can severely damage the little one�s faith and at such times, they could be discouraged and walk away from faith. Jesus reminds his disciples the danger of causing little ones to sin and talked about millstones. A millstone is very heavy, if we are thrown with a millstone tied round our neck, we can�t survive. By saying this, Jesus is saying how serious a sin it is to cause a little one to fall. Jesus sacrificed his own life to save even the smallest soul. We � who are called as his disciples � must cherish the people God has entrusted to us and serve them with gentleness and humility. 
Apostle Paul in Corinthians 8 shows us how much he struggled to protect those who were spiritually weak not to fall. It seems in the Corinthian church people with strong faith were eating meat which had been offered to idols and this had made the people with little faith to fall. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 8:9 �Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling-block to the weak.� And in verse 12-13, �When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to fall.� Paul denied his own freedom in order to protect the people who had little faith. Jesus likewise teaches his disciples to be careful of their influence and look after the little ones well. 
Look at verse 3.  �So watch yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.� We need to care for people with weak faith, that they may not fall, and serve them with love. However, when our brother sins, we should not ignore his sin or cover it up, but should rebuke him. This means to help him realise his sins and return to God. Rebuking is, like an operation, painful but fundamentally that is the way to save a soul. Not everybody can rebuke, but only those who truly love and pray for the person and know the consequence of sins. Proverbs 27:5 says, �Better is open rebuke than hidden love.� In that sense a rebuke is a true expression of love. Those who rebuke also need to help the person with God�s word. The purpose of a rebuke lies in helping the person to realise his sin, return to God and receive life to the full. Therefore, those who are rebuked must not take the rebuke lightly but accept it with a good heart. 
What should we do when the brother repents? Jesus says to forgive him. We need to forgive him. It is not easy to forgive those who have harmed us. Often tragedy in this world has its root in an unforgiving heart. We would like to think believers find it easier to forgive others but often that is not the case. Even believers find they can�t forgive each other and this can make them vulnerable to Satan�s attack. Satan attacks those who have been hurt and tempts them into a spiral of bitterness and resentment. All problems between people start from this lack of forgiveness. Therefore we need to understand how important it is to forgive and fight spiritually against falling into bitterness. The dilemma is we know that we need to forgive but we have no power to do so. How can we find the power? The answer is Jesus, we need to come to him and ask him for it. Only those who find the power from Christ�s love can forgive people. Then how much do we need to forgive? Jesus says �If he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times comes back to you and says, 'I repent,' forgive him.� This just sounds impossible. In Matthew�s gospel, Jesus says that we need to forgive our brothers seventy seven times in a single day. This means to forgive without limit. This is because God has done the same for us. He has forgiven our sins unconditionally. The principle of a mature person�s faith should be that he/she is strict on himself/herself and generous towards others. To forgive a brother who has repented is God�s command. We can�t insist that we are victims. We can�t also say to God we were right and they were wrong. Instead, we need to forgive our brother�s weaknesses. When we do so, our heart becomes full of God�s love. 
Look at verse 5. �The apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith!� The  apostles were amazed at what Jesus said. They thought that what Jesus was asking was impossible. �You�re telling us that we shouldn�t lead people to astray and you�re telling us to love people enough to rebuke them and you are telling us to endlessly forgive and that�s beyond us! Increase our faith!� We can also be like the disciples. We can think it is impossible for us in our current situations to live a standard of life that Jesus wants us to live.  We can become passive, thinking that we can�t do anything because our faith is so small. What did Jesus say to them? Look at verse 6. �He replied, If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.� Jesus says that they can do great things such as uprooting a mulberry tree even if they have faith as small as a mustard seed. A mulberry tree has a very deep root and it is impossible to uproot the tree and throw it into the sea. Without faith, this looks simply impossible. Hence, without faith, one can�t even think of trying this. Forgiving our brother�s sin is like this. Sin is deeply rooted like a mulberry tree. It can�t be uprooted with just a couple of attempts. Some people struggle with their lustful desire, some with hatred, some with pride, some with doubt, some with laziness, greed, jealousy, etc. Some have complex problems all deeply rooted in their hearts. Fighting against our sins is not easy. Some people seek to give up. But, we can�t serve the gospel work without fighting against sins.
Jesus helps his disciples to overcome any limited thinking, by telling them to have faith as small as mustard seed. There is nothing that is impossible in God. And God works through our faith. Jesus wants from us not a massive faith but as small as mustard seed faith. 
Jesus is teaching his disciples about the power of faith. If anyone has faith even as small as mustard seed, they won�t give up but will try. If they fail, they will try again. If one doesn�t have faith, often the response is to complain about the situation and give up, but God continues his ministry through those who challenge the impossible by faith. The disciples already had faith as small as a mustard seed. They could already do a great thing with this faith. People who all the time sigh about their lack of faith will not be able to do anything even if they have been given the opportunity, because of their unbelief. Because of their unbelief, they live a helpless life.  They won�t try to grab the opportunity by faith or challenge the situation � but rather, will remain in defeatism and fatalism and waste their precious life. Those people � even if they lived a life of faith for a long time, won�t be able to do anything. But, those who live with a mustard-like small faith and ask God�s help all the time can do a great thing for him � re-write the history. 

I have two questions, what does it mean to have faith as small as a mustard seed and how can I have this faith? A mustard seed is small, Jesus is making the point to his disciples that their faith may be small but it is who they put their faith in that matters. Sometimes we pay too much attention to how weak we are, how small we are, how limited we are, and in contrast how big the problems and obstacles we face are. Jesus is saying, it doesn�t matter that your faith is small or that the obstacles you are facing are big, what matters is that you put your faith in me and trust God. God is Almighty, all powerful. There is nothing he cannot do. This is very well illustrated by the example of David and Goliath. David was small, his obstacle was big, but he trusted in God to give him the victory. The rest of the Israelite army was bigger than David but because they had forgotten about God and were just looking at Goliath they had fallen into a spirit of defeat and were lying in a state of paralysis on the side of the hill. David was regarded as na�ve, foolish, ridiculous but he simply trusted that his God was bigger than Goliath. His faith was pure faith and child-like innocent and absolute faith.  That is mustard seed faith!

So, how can we have this faith? Jesus talks about the Mulberry tree which represents something that is impossible and immovable. We are faced challenges and obstacles in life that are similarly immovable; whether it be to forgive someone, or to have the faith to help someone spiritually, or to defeat some sin problem in our own hearts. As a  ministry we are face with the challenge of disciple making. To find one person to serve with the gospel, can seem so difficult, impossible. We can think of all the reasons why it is so difficult, but Jesus says simply trust me. Trust that whatever the obstacle, God is bigger and more powerful. The way to trust Jesus is the same as it was when we first came to him with our early simple small pure childlike faith. Simply trust in one word, one promise and obey it. Hold God�s word in our hearts, keep remembering it throughout the day, keep struggling to obey it, let it become flesh in us, that it may change us, and obey the challenge it gives us. �Father, forgive them,� �Remain in Jesus�, �You give them something to eat�; whatever it is, it is a mustard seed.  

Verses 7-10 teaches us what kinds of attitude we should have after serving a great work of God. It is easy for us to become self-righteous after working hard for God. This grieves God. Jesus wants his disciples to remain humble after working hard for God. So he gave his disciples this example of an unworthy servant. A man had a faithful servant. He worked hard all day in the field and came back tired. He must have been exhausted and hungry. Yet, the master did not prepare him supper nor serve him. Instead, he asked him to prepare his supper and get ready and wait on him while he eats and drinks. This was the servant�s position. In those days servants did not rest even if they had worked hard all day. They weren�t hurt even if the master didn�t commend their hard working. It�s because fundamentally he is a servant, his attitude, his way of thinking about himself, his very identity is as a servant. It is natural for a servant to work for his master. Jesus says in conclusion in verse 10 � �So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'� Jesus wants us to have the attitude of unworthy servants � these servants are indeed so worthy and precious. People want recognition and praise from others for what they have done. However, when we seek such recognition and praise, we can�t grow spiritually and become really unworthy servants. It is deadly crucial for us to overcome our pride and self-righteousness after working hard for God and remain humble like the un-worthy servant. To grow as Jesus� disciple, we need to learn the attitude of this unworthy servant. Then, what is the servant�s attitude like?  First of all, the servant in the passage said, �we have only done our duty.� People with this attitude do not seek recognition or praise from people. Instead, they feel indebted and always humble. They struggle to be more faithful today than yesterday. We need to have this unworthy servant�s attitude. We are struggling to serve the pioneering ministry. But, all of these are only our duty as those who have been saved by grace. We therefore should not seek recognition. We need to realise that we have only done our duty. 

Apostle Paul served a pioneering work in many places with his whole life. It is unbelievable how much he did through four mission journeys. However, he was never proud or became complacent. At the last period of his life he was jailed yet he did not feel sense of loss or blame God. Instead, in the jail he testified to the Philippian believers �Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining towards what is ahead, I press on towards the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenwards in Christ Jesus.� It is a great victory that we overcome our busy life and work hard for God. But, Jesus wants us � one step further -to continually grow mature with the attitude of an unworthy servant.  


?. Faith that thanks (11-19) 

Look at Verse 11. ?ow on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus travelled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice, Jesus, Master, have pity on us!   Jews and Samaritans did not usually associate with each other. However, lepers, who were ostracised from the main society, didn�t seem to care about this. They looked horrible and lived without any hope. One day however they heard the great news of Jesus� coming. They thought Jesus could heal them. Because of this faith, they came to Jesus and shouted � master, have pity on us! Jesus � though he was on his way to Jerusalem to die on the cross- didn�t ignore their plea. He healed them. How happy would they have been? We also have received the same joy when we first met Jesus. We were like these lepers who suffered from the power of sin and death, yet Jesus forgave us and restored us. They must have shouted �praise the Lord� endlessly. However, only one of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him� and he was a Samaritan. Jesus asked, �Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? Was no-one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner? Then he said to him, Rise and go; your faith has made you well.� Jesus was sad with nine people who didn�t thank him.

Here, we can learn how hard it is to give thanks after receiving grace. There are many people in the world who ask grace but there are only a few who indeed give thanks after receiving grace. People who give thanks for the grace they have received are spiritually mature people. Those who do not thank are like spiritual lepers. It is easy for us to become like those 9 unthankful lepers. We can lose thankful heart as time goes by. Apostle Paul said in 1 Thessalonians 5:18 �Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.� Humility and thankfulness are the indicators of one�s mature faith. Jesus was sad with the nine unthankful lepers but was very happy with Samaritan who gave thanks and blessed his faith all the more.  Look at verse 19. �Then he said to him, Rise and go; your faith has made you well.� He was not only healed from his physical leprosy but also was healed from his spiritual leprosy � that is, sin.  When we give thanks to God daily we can glorify God and we will receive all the more grace. 
In conclusion, we are called by God as his shepherds to serve his little ones. We need to serve our neighbours and people with mustard-seed like faith and love to forgive. May he help us to remember his grace and grow as thankful servants of God.
