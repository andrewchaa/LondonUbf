2011 Luke 22 

BUT SEEK HIS KINGDOM

Luke 12:1-34
Key verse 12:31
But seek his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well.

In today�s passage many thousands of people come to Jesus, but he speaks first to his disciples. As future spiritual leaders he warns them of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and the dangers of all kinds of greed. We are living in the world where personal image and greed are rampant. Like the disciples we can be tempted by hypocrisy and a wrong attitude to money and material things, yet in Jesus� teaching here we can find a way out of both. Through this passage, I pray that we may learn freshly to seek our Father�s kingdom and learn to be free of both people and greed.
   
?. Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees (1-12)

Look at verse 1a. �Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so the6 were trampling on one another.� So many people were coming to hear from Jesus. Jesus was attracting the kind of celebrity status of a modern day rock band like U2 or Radio Head. Yet here people came to hear the words of their shepherd. Most towns and villages had only a hundred or so people so to make up many thousands was extraordinary. We can imagine how excited disciples would have been! They had recently confessed Jesus as Christ and expected him to be the Messiah and leader of the new kingdom. Their dream was coming true! Yet at this time of popularity, Jesus chose to speak first to his disciples and warn them of the dangers of image and pretence. What did Jesus say � �Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.� The Pharisees were the religious leaders who looked holy and good. Yet, in reality, they lived a double life. They loved enjoyed the status, authority, and power that came from being a religious leader more than a relationship to God or his word. They didn�t struggle to please God or live in his sight but sought to give an image of religious morality and respectability before the people. Jesus said to his disciples to be on their guard against the yeast of Pharisees. 

It is perhaps easy when reading the gospels to be down on the Pharisees without realising how subtle a trap, particularly for leaders, hypocrisy is. With spiritual leadership comes a pressure to live up to expectation and it is true leaders should lead by example. The problem comes when the reality of one�s inner life does not match the example one knows one should give. The danger is then simply to pretend, to go on projecting an image of morality, respectability, and religiosity while hiding and covering up one�s sin. Yet hypocrisy never works for long. Jesus describes it as yeast. The reason is it spreads, it ultimately contaminates all the people. People find out about the double life and become cynical and lose their trust in their leaders and ultimately damages their relationship to God.  

So how does Jesus help his disciples against the danger hypocrisy? First he helps his disciples think about God�s sight. Look at verses 2-3. �There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in daylight and what you have whispered in the year in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.� Jesus is saying we can hide sin from people but we can never hide anything from God. God sees everything, he knows our innermost thoughts and ultimately he will reveal everything. Hypocrisy is stupid because it simply doesn�t work. We cannot mock God, everything eventually comes out. 

Second, he helps his disciples to fear God, not people. Look at verse 4. �I tell you my friends do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.� One of the root problems of hypocrisy is fear of people. We get trapped by what people think of us and therefore want to hide our reality. This can be particularly a problem for Christians as time goes by. When we first come to faith, we are happy to acknowledge our sin and weakness, we naturally then cling to Jesus and his mercy and forgiveness on the cross. We confess and repent and enjoy his grace. But as time goes on we can begin to feel �I should be doing better than this, it�s shameful to have to keep repenting of the same sins to my co-workers, I should be making �progress.� Then we begin to cover over and clean up our image before people, while the reality of our sin remains untouched and gets worse.  This has the effect of making light of sin and rendering Jesus� gospel ineffective because we don�t properly bring to him our reality.

So what is the answer Jesus gives us? Look at verse 5 �But I will show you whom you should fear: fear him who after the killing of the body has power to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.� �Fear him� which means fear God as God. Fear here, means to have the perspective that my relationship to God is far more important than anything else, because he is judge and my forgiveness lies in him. In that sense to fear God means to respect, honour and love him with all my heart. It means to care most about what God thinks. It means to want to please him and make him happy. It means to fear any sin that might get in between me and my creator God. When I fear God and my relationship to him is most precious to me, then I can overcome the temptation to pretend in front of people. God doesn�t want my hypocrisy Jesus didn�t die on the cross so that I pretend I�m someone I�m not. He wants me as I am. Then I can come honestly and sincerely in repentance as the way to enjoy God.

The trouble with fearing God is it can give us a threatening image of God. In verses 6-7 Jesus also emphasises how much God loves us. �Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don�t be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows.� God cares about even the life of a sparrow. Sometimes, we think our future and life depends on our parents, bosses at work or teachers. Yet, our life and our future are in the hands of our father God � who is our Sovereign, Almighty Lord. Only when we look up and put our faith in him can we overcome fear of people. 


II. A man�s life doesn�t� consist in the abundance of his possession.

In verse 13, while Jesus was teaching, one man among the crowd came to him and said �teacher � tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.� Remember everyone was trampling to get to Jesus? This man got to the front, it�s quite an achievement, there he is standing before the Christ, the way, the truth and the life, he could ask him anything and he asks him this, how sad. It reveals how his mind is captured by greed. He must have had problems with his brother in dividing the inheritance. Perhaps, his brother didn�t share the money but had all by himself. He came to Jesus with bitter heart. Because of this problem, he could not concentrate on Jesus� teaching. His heart was occupied with this problem. Somehow by Jesus� help, he wanted to solve this problem and received the inheritance. How did Jesus help him? 

Look at verses 14-15. �Jesus replied, �Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you? Then he said to them. Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man�s life doesn�t� consist in the abundance of his possessions.� This man must have felt bitter and lonely. He obviously felt the problem lay with his brother. Yet, from Jesus� point of view, the fundamental problem was his greed. Because of greed, he didn�t know how to be satisfied with what he had.. Jesus says be on your guard on all kinds of greed. He also said that a man�s life doesn�t� consist in the abundance of his possession. This man thought if the problem was solved and if he received the money, he will be joyful and happy. Yet, Jesus said that a man�s happiness doesn�t lie in possessions. He wanted the man to repent his greed and be reconciled with his brother. He wanted him to love his greedy brother and serve God.

Jesus used a parable to teach the crowd that a man�s life doesn�t lie in the abundance of his possessions. There was a rich man who had the happy problem of having produced a good crop and didn�t have a place to store it. Look at verse 17-20. �He thought to himself, �What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops�� And I will say to myself � you have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy � eat, drink and be merry. This is what people in our generation think exactly. People think good job, good marriage will make them be merry. But God said to him, �You you fool!� this very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself!�

Why is he a fool? First,  Even though he had gathered a lot of money and prepared for his future, he didn�t prepare anything for his eternal life. He wanted to live a good � abundant life in this world and enjoy retirement. He was talented and hard working but his motivation was simply retirement, He didn�t think about things that would last for eternity such as his character and soul, his spiritual growth, relationship to God. He didn�t think about serving others and helping them know God. That�s sadly quite normal, but Jesus says you fool. God said � �This very night your life will be demanded from you.� How sad he had prepared for his future � yet had prepared nothing for his soul in eternity. 

Secondly, he is a fool because he had no life direction. His life goal was to simply eat, drink and be merry. It was a physical life without mission. How empty this is. After escaping from Egypt, the only hope of Israelites was to eat well in the land of milk and honey and be merry. Because of their wrong hope, they couldn�t cope with the difficulties during the Exodus. God called them and gave them a great vision and hope � �Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant then out of all nations you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.� God planted a hope and vision to hopeless people who were only interested in eating and being merry. This hope gave the Israelites clear life direction and helped them to persevere with great joy. In the midst of difficulty, they had a vision to be holy priests for the whole world. Men are not just physical animals, yet too often people live as pigs. Our TV programmes are full of shows like �Flog it� and home improvement or holiday programmes. Our souls can�t be satisfied by just material existence. We need a holy vision and life direction from God. When we have those things and take up our crosses daily for God�s glory we then can be truly happy. 

Thirdly, he was a fool because he didn�t realize that his life is in God�s hands not in his own hands. He proudly said � �you have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy � eat, drink and be merry.� But God said ��this very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself!� He thought he could make plans but he didn�t realize that he had no control whatsoever of his life. 

Look at verse 21.  �This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich towards God.� The man had been rich towards himself, he talked of �my crops, my barns, my grain, myself, with no thought of God� Being materially rich or poor is not the point. Wealth and poverty are relative. We might think we are poor but we are some of the wealthiest people in the world. Europe�s problem is materialism, not hunger or poverty. The point is to be rich towards God, with our time, our money our heart, our energy our lives, and in the way we serve others. Our life is in God not in possessions. He gives us happiness. People who are rich to God therefore are truly wise people and blessed people. People who are stingy to God are the fools. May God help us to be rich to God and his redemptive work so that we may be truly wise in God�s eyes.

?. But seek his kingdom (22-34)

Look at verse 22. �Then Jesus said to his disciples: therefore I tell you do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear.� Having left everything to follow Jesus, the disciples could be tempted to worry, but Jesus helped them with the example of ravens and lilies.

Look at verse 24. �Consider the ravens: they do not sow or reap they have no storeroom or barn yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds!� Jesus talks about ravens. Nobody feeds ravens, yet they survive daily. It is because God feeds them and takes care of them. Therefore we should not worry. Worry comes when we doubt God�s love for us. Look at verse 25-26.  �Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?� Worry is useless in all aspects and therefore we should not worry at all. 

Look at verses 27-28. �Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labour or spin. Yet I tell you not even Solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!� Jesus told them to consider lilies. They don�t labour or spin yet their beauty can�t be even compared with the glories of Solomon. When we think how God looks after lilies which are to be thrown into fire tomorrow, we can think of how God would feed and look after us, who are bought by the blood of his only son Jesus! Jesus gently rebukes his disciples here saying �you little faith.� Worry doesn�t originate from the situation but from one�s unbelief in God.

In this world, it often looks as if there are many things to worry about. People � parents, friends, bosses and colleagues, professors- make us to worry about an uncertain future. When we hear their worries, we become worried. Yet, Jesus helps his disciples who were tempted to worry to look up their heavenly father. He helped them to meditate on God who even feeds the ravens and lilies faithfully. Jesus planted faith in the disciples that God  - their heavenly father � will take care of them and feed them. 
In this passage I really see the problem of fear and worry as the enemy of a life of faith. Fear of people leads to hypocrisy, worry about possessions make us fear about giving to God and being rich towards him. But fear and worry always is a matter of our thought world. It lies in our minds and hearts. In order to conquer fear and worry, we have to set our minds and hearts on God. Jesus says don�t fear men fear God, don�t worry about possessions be rich to God, Consider his power to provide for the ravens consider his love in the beauty of the lilies. It�s a question of meditating on, seeking God! Let�s conclude by reading verse 31, �But seek first his kingdom, and all these things will be given to you as well�
