2011 Luke 6

YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN

Luke 5:12-26
Key verse 5:20
When Jesus saw their faith, he said, 'Friend, your sins are forgiven.'

Today's message is 'Your sins are forgiven'. These are the greatest and most important words that you can ever hear.  Nothing is more important than this. Sin makes our lives sick and corrupt. Sin makes our lives dry and withered. But most of all sin separates us from our God and if not forgiven sin leads to judgement and eternal torment in hell. It must be dealt with. The amazing news is that Jesus declares he has authority to forgive sins. Luke has just told us of the calling of Simon Peter ' 'don't be afraid from now on you will catch men'. It is amazing to see the example Jesus set as they set off and learned to 'catch men'. Who do they catch? A leper ' a disfigured, lonely outcast in society ' and a paralysed man. I pray we may see the amazing compassion in Jesus and hear these great words, 'your sins are forgiven'. 

I. Jesus heals a leper (12-16)

First Jesus healed a leper. Look verse 12: 'While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, 'Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.'' When Jesus was in one of the towns, a man who was covered with leprosy came to him. 

Let's think for a moment about leprosy and this man. The bible translators are at pains to tell us that the Greek word used here for leprosy covers a number of skin conditions. It's a word lepis meaning 'scaly' so includes psoriasis, lupus, skin cancers, ringworm and the like. But the fact that the physician, Luke, tells us this man was 'covered' tells us that he was very sick and had the disease recognized today as leprosy. Today leprosy or Hansen's disease is easily curable but even so there are still millions affected by it even now. Google will give you up to date images. HD is caused by a bacterium that numbs the senses and destroys feeling. Usually starting with the head and face it spread. As he lost all feeling gradually he would inadvertently damage his fingers, lips, eyes and toes and begin to lose them all together because of the small damage done each day. He was increasingly disfigured until he was covered. But more than that, he suffered in his mind. He was isolated from the world by his loss of feeling and by the fear of his fellow human beings. As Leviticus 14 tells he would need to announce his presence, declaring himself 'unclean'. And while some showed pity and would give him charity, most would throw stones to drive him away from themselves and their loved ones. In short, this man was tormented because of his illness. He was a human being. But because of his leprosy, he was a man no one wanted to catch.  To make matters worse some thought leprosy was God's curse for sin in their life. So when they needed compassion lepers had to leave their families, communities and live outside of camp separated from society. 

What did he ask of Jesus? Look at verse 12b. 'When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, 'Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.' He fell with his face to the ground and begged him. Pausing there for a moment - have you ever seen a man with fall with his face to the ground? It's not easy putting your face to the ground. For this man his joints are affected and are stiff.  Yet he simply fell at Jesus' feet. Why? To worship. It's a picture of worship. And notice that he does this before Jesus heals him. Some people come to Jesus and say, 'If you give me this or if you do that then I will worship you'. But this man worships Jesus because Jesus is worthy not because of what he has done for him. Second he 'begged him'. Have you ever seen a man beg for help? Not just money but anxious for help. The man is utterly desperate. He begged Jesus because he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that without Jesus' help he has nothing ' no hope, no chance ' apart from the grace of Jesus. This should be our attitude to Jesus. 

How does Jesus respond? Look at verse 13: 'Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. 'I am willing,' he said. 'Be clean!' And immediately the leprosy left him.' How does Jesus respond? Jesus reached out and touched the man. Of course Jesus could say to the man, 'Be clean. Now run along to the priest'.  But Jesus touches him. Touch is important. It is a sign of affection and love. I come home and one of my joys is wrestling with Sam and Joseph. When I come home Anna is very affectionate. She likes to go on my shoulders and cuddle up. If I've had a shave she likes to kiss me ' if not then I'm too hairy! The truth is I love it. We communicate our love partly by touch. I have told some the true account of a man whose wife and daughter had died and he was left alone. It meant he never touched anyone. So starved of this basic human need he went to the hairdresser every week just so that someone would touch him. This leper has not been touched for may be 15 or 20 years. He is lonely. He is desperate. And Jesus reaches out and touches him. Likewise Jesus reaches out to sinners to let them know that he sympathises with our weakness and shame. Notice that Jesus does not wait for the man to become clean before he touches him. Jesus touches our lives the moment we come to him by faith. Jesus is willing to touch our lives the moment we come to him in our weakness. 

Second, Jesus helped the man with his word. After touching him Jesus said. 'I am willing! Be clean!' Jesus gave this man a very precious promise that could be with him forever. 'I am willing.' Our dirty sins and our shame make us feel that no one could be willing to accept us or help us to be clean. Even as believers at times we think our sin is too much and we feel dirty. But we must not allow the devil's whispering and accusations to take control of our hearts. Instead, we must hear Jesus' voice, 'I am willing.' Jesus is willing to help anyone who comes to him in faith. This is his absolute promise. By faith in this promise, we who have been so tormented by sin can trust that not only will we be changed, but we have the hope of being completely cleansed. Jesus says in John's gospel 'whoever comes to me I will never drive away' (John 6:37). Jesus did not come to clean us up just a little bit. Jesus came to clean us up completely, so that we will be acceptable in the kingdom of God next to his angels and the holy saints. But Jesus did not just give the man his promise, saying 'I am willing.' Jesus also gave the man his command, 'Be clean!' Jesus will for us is to be clean. Just as the leper had to leave behind his leper's clothes, and go and make sacrifices before the priest at the temple, so we must accept Jesus' promise and command and leave behind our sinful habits and fears, and begin to live a new clean life by the power of the Holy Spirit. 

What amazing thing happened? 'And immediately the leprosy left him.' (13b). His skin was immediately healed. I don't know if he got his fingers and toes back. Or if his eyelids and lips were restored but he was immediately healed. Look at verse 14: 'Then Jesus ordered him, 'Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.' Jesus restored the man to society again. 

OK where are we? As we read this we can say, 'Yes it's amazing that Jesus did that for this man. But it's not something I will ever see today. Leprosy is not a problem here today'. But the truth is we are like lepers. We are sinful and dirty. And unlike leprosy it's a condition that is incurable. We think 'but that's not me'. It's because the earth is one big leper colony and we don't get as disgusted as God does at the ugly sight of our sin. We are numb to how disfigured and sick we are because of the leprosy of sin. In short, people stop caring about the damage they are doing to themselves because they cannot feel it. Sin is not always immediately obvious. But when do not repent, the affect accumulates ' it makes us progressively selfish, indifferent and materialistic. We become further and further isolated from others. And worst of all, sin makes spiritual numbness set in. This is the devil's desire in tempting us to sin in the first place. I heard a story of a man called John Elliot who became trapped in the Rockies in SW Alberta during a terrible blizzard. He became exhausted with the snow and tried to rest in a half abandoned cabin. But he was so tired he fell asleep. But a St Bernard dog kept whining and pressing him and finally managed to wake him up. After being rescued he said. "If that dog hadn't been with me, I'd be dead today.' He said something interesting about the cold. He said 'when you're freezing to death you actually feel warm all over, and don't wake up because it feels too good."

This is the spiritual condition of many today: cold spiritually but oblivious of their true condition. Later Jesus would warn the church in Laodicea 'You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.' (Rev 3:17).

But in contrast some know they are dirty and unclean. They know that their lives are weak, broken, dirty and disfigured. Perhaps worse is the dirt we feel when we sin after believing in Jesus. At first we are quick to accept but as we go on in a Christian life we still sin and feel unclean and dirty. The amazing truth is that Jesus cleanses. Jesus puts a hand on us too, just like he did the leper. In Christ you are clean. In Christ you are not filthy. The lust, jealousy, inferiority, bitterness, selfishness ' cleaned by Jesus. The things done to you that made you dirty are gone in Christ. In Christ you are made clean by the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus takes away the filth and gives back dignity and purpose. This is the Christian doctrine of expiation ' that the cross of Jesus does not only forgive but takes away our sin and makes us clean. In Christ you are new! This is our God. What should we do? Like this man fall in worship, ask for Jesus help and believe his desire to cleanse: 'I am willing. Be clean'.

What happened after this event? Look at verses 15-16: 'Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.' The news about Jesus spread all the more, so the crowds of people gathered around Jesus yet he often withdrew to lonely places and prayed. This is a great insight into Jesus' ministry and the rhythm of his life. Luke likes to tell us of Jesus' prayer and here we see that having looked after others Jesus looked after himself. It took power for Jesus to heal the man. Jesus knew he needed to take time away to be with the father. Likewise for us it takes power to help others. It takes power to serve, teach the bible and so on. It is easy to lose power, to lose wisdom and lose Jesus' mission. Therefore Jesus withdrew to lonely places and prayed in order to come to the Father. Through this, Jesus renewed God's power and wisdom and sustained his ministry. 

II. Your sins are forgiven (17-26)
  
The second 'catch' was a paralysed man. Look at verse 17: 'One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick.' Although Jesus appears to have tried to keep the healing of the leper secret news about Jesus spread all the more until Pharisees and teachers of the law came. This is the first time that they are mentioned in Luke's gospel. It seems that they came from every corner of Israel to check him out. They sat there with a lot of theology and ideas about healing. But Jesus was very different. He had the power to heal and that power was present that day.
  
Look at verses 18-19:'Some men came carrying a paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.' When Jesus was teaching, some men came carrying a paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. We don't know how this man came to be like this. Perhaps he had been injured leaving him paralysed and these men were his friends who carried them. There is a lot we could say but the point is they did everything they could to get their friend to Jesus. They did not despair or say 'I've done enough' or 'maybe next time'. These friends remind us that true friendship is not a matter of convenience or common interests. True friendship is a commitment to one another as human beings, to care for each other and to help each other, no matter what. Today technology makes it easier and easier for us to have acquaintances ' I was quite proud that I gained well over 200 friends on facebook without doing anything. But then I realised that I would not even recognise 90% of them if they walked into this room. True friendships are few and far between. People are too busy with their own plans and dreams to allow themselves to be tied down and burdened by commitments to others. But at the same time people are find they are alone. It is the curse of our economic success. We don't think we need others to survive in this world. But it is a mistake. When we cut off all commitments to others and focus only on ourselves, we find ourselves cut off from our Creator God and his body, the Church. Being a Christian is not a matter of saying the right things or believing the right things. It is a matter of repenting our selfishness and accepting Jesus invitation to have eternal friendship with him and with everyone who belongs to him. These men are a great example of that. 

The crowd must have been angry at the men. The Pharisees and teachers of the law must have been indignant. But look at Jesus! Look at verse 20: 'When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."' First Jesus saw their faith. Jesus saw the faith of the friends who had the conviction of the Holy Spirit that Jesus could help their paralyzed friend to walk again. Jesus saw the faith of the paralytic, who had not lost hope, but who trusted in Jesus. 

Second Jesus called him 'friend'. Jesus felt an immediate bond with these men who loved each other with a pure and holy love based on faith in God. So, he called the paralytic, 'Friend.' The kingdom of God is not about harps and music and singing old fashioned songs. The kingdom of God is about the friendship that Jesus came to show men, and which he demonstrated so that we might be good friends to one another in Jesus. Jesus called him friend. If I can speak plainly ' how well do you know the person sitting next to you? Or in front of you? How are your friendships with people here in this room? This matters. Faith brings us into friendship with Jesus and with others. If we are weak in our friendship with others chances are we are weak in our friendship with Jesus. 

Look again at verse 20 ' Jesus said 'Friend, your sins are forgiven.' Jesus did not say 'Friend your paralysis has gone' rather he said 'Your sins are forgiven.' That is a big statement. No other religious leader says this; Mohammed, Krishna, Buddha. They don't say, 'Your sins are forgiven.' They say, 'We've uncovered a process by which you can go through these rituals or routines or lifestyle and maybe someday God will forgive you.' Or 'you will be made better and reincarnated further up the food chain'. Yet Jesus says, 'Forgiven. I can just forgive.' Jesus' heart was burdened by the man's need for forgiveness. Somehow, this seems to the modern man to be insensitive. What if you went to Haiti and after the earthquake tell them 'your sins are forgiven'? It would sound like you are blaming them for the tragedy. But Jesus knew that the greatest suffering is not from human tragedies like earthquake or paralysis (although of course these are serious) but from sin. Men fear tragedies like leprosy or paralysis but these are just a shadow of the greater problem caused by sin and judgement that is to come. The incredible declaration is that Jesus forgives sin!

Look at verse 21. 'The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"' The religious leaders were aghast at how Jesus had helped the paralytic. They were expecting to see a miraculous healing that they might analyze for its authenticity but Jesus challenged their basic assumptions about themselves and about God. It was risky but Jesus challenged them in verse 22-23: 'Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?' They thought Jesus did not have authority to proclaim forgiveness. They thought anybody can just say that but Jesus proved his authority to forgive sins. Look at verse 24-25 'But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."' The religious leaders were right. Only God can forgive sins. But Jesus healed the paralytic so that they, and us, might know that Jesus has been given the authority from God to forgive our sins. The miracle was so amazing. Lepers are not healed. Paralytics do not get up and walk. But we must see the real meaning behind it. Jesus is God. Only Jesus has authority on earth to forgive our sins. We can praise God that this man was healed but the big miracle, the exciting part, is that his sins were forgiven. Jesus can and does heal people. Jesus can and does bless people with things. But if you can chose between forgiveness and healing, forgiveness is what you want. It is the best and most important words imaginable. 
  
In conclusion like the leper and the paralysed man we need Jesus. Only Jesus can make us clean. Only Jesus can forgive our sins. May God bless us to know Jesus' authority to forgive our sins! May God bless us to practice real friendship with God and with God's people!
