2011 Luke 12

HEAR THE WORD

Luke 8:1-21
Key Verse 8:15 
But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. 

In this passage Jesus compares his ministry of the word to a farmer sowing his seed. The farmer sows the seed which has great potential to produce a crop. However the quality of the soil really matters. Jesus sows his word but how we hear it matters. I pray today we may hear Jesus� word freshly, retain it and persevere, that we may bear a crop for the glory of God. 

I.	Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear

Look at verse 1. �After this, Jesus travelled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him.�  Jesus preached his word in many different towns. His focus was in preaching the good news of the kingdom of God. This was what he really wanted to give to all people. He didn�t just want to improve people�s lives, help them be successful or focus on simply healing them physically. He wanted to give people something much more valuable, essential and life giving. The good news is that God sent Jesus as the promised Messiah. Anyone who repents and believes in Jesus can receive the kingdom of God. God wants to rule us with his truth, and love. When we are ruled by our King Jesus, we can enjoy his peace, joy and grace and bear the fruit of righteousness for his glory. When Jesus rules us everything is affected and transformed, our relations to people, our community, what we hope and live for. We come to understand that we have eternity in the kingdom of God. This was Jesus� focus in his preaching, when we preach the word of God, we also need to preach the good news of the kingdom of God. 

Jesus took his twelve disciples wherever he went. They were weak and immature. Yet, Jesus took them wherever he went with the hope that they would grow as great apostles for the next generation. In addition, women accompanied Jesus, serving and supporting his ministry. They included Mary Magdalene, Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod�s household and Susanna among many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. Mary Magdalene had been possessed by seven demons. She must have been miserable and hopeless. Yet, Jesus visited her and rescued her from all seven demons. He restored her completely and made her a new creation. She knew his amazing grace very well and because of this, she served Jesus sacrificially more than anyone else. Joanna was the wife of Chuza who was the manager of Herod�s household. She could have lived a comfortable, wealthy life. Yet here she is following Jesus! Having met Jesus she must have realised the emptiness and meaninglessness of such a life. Jesus saw her inner problem and saved her. There were many other women including Susanna who sacrificially served Jesus� ministry behind the scenes out of their own means. Their labour, serving and love reveal how different and extraordinary Jesus ministry was. He valued women highly in a way that would be unthinkable to the Pharisees. He valued their prayer and their support and their role in the ministry was absolutely vital. 

Look at verse 4.  �While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable.� A large crowd came to Jesus to hear him preach. Jesus taught them with a parable. Parables use an example of natural phenomena or from daily life in a way that anyone could understand.  However, to understand the real, hidden meaning of a parable, one needs to have spiritual desire and a humble attitude to learn. Then, what was the parable? �A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.  Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.  Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.� (5-8) After giving this parable, Jesus said, �Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.�  Why did he say this? Here ears mean spiritual ears. Jesus didn�t just want the crowd to come and listen and leave untouched. He wanted them to really hear, in a way that would change their lives. Perhaps Jesus had detected in the crowd a lack of spiritual desire, and he wanted them to really think again about their attitude and how they were listening; He wanted them to know they had a responsibility to listen. Perhaps he saw in a few of them hard critical hearts like the Pharisees or anxious, distracted restless people. When preaching you can see so well how people are listening and whether they are drifting off or thinking about something else! Those who have ears to hear God�s word listen to his word with spiritual desire to know more and have the humility to obey what they hear. These people are always full of God�s word and bear much fruit. Let�s pray to have ears that hear.
When Jesus finished talking, some perhaps left the place without having further desire to know what Jesus said. Yet, Jesus� disciples wanted to know more about what he said and the meaning of the parable. They had a sense of problem in their lives and had desire to learn by all means. They had humility to learn from Jesus. They wanted to learn more about the word of truth and struggled to live according to it. Jesus was very pleased with them and told them �the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you.� Jesus gives the privilege of knowing the kingdom of God to those who love the truth and struggle to live by it. Yet, those who have no spiritual desire can�t see or appreciate it and even if they hear it often, they can�t understand what it means. Secrets of the kingdom of God are like hidden pearls. Only those who know the value of those pearls can find them. Pearls have no value to pigs. There is so much precious treasure in Jesus� words, such as forgiveness, living hope, eternal life, truth and the meaningful way to live, mission, etc. The author of Psalm 1 emphasises meditating on the word of God day and night. May God help us to have the ears to hear and meditate on his words day and night so that we can possess the secrets of the kingdom of God and be truly blessed.


?. Hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop (11-21)
Jesus explained the meaning of the parable to his disciples. In that parable, seed means the word of God and the place where the seed fell means people�s heart. Jesus says that there are four kinds of hearts. 

First, path-like heart. Look at verse 12. �Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.� A path is soil that is trodden under foot over time. It is hard and the seed can�t penetrate. Likewise, people�s hearts become hard over time. There are different reasons for a hard heart, no-one is born with a hard heart, children have soft hearts, but life experience can work to make people cynical, or proud. People begin to rely on their own thinking or common sense and no longer can receive the word. These people have very strong opinions and have biased ideas for the word of God. The devil steals the word from these people�s hearts so that they may not be saved. Whether we accept the word of God or not has a direct consequence for our salvation. Satan knows this very well and does all he can to stop us receiving it. He steals the word when we are thinking of something else or dozing off while listening to the word of God. Therefore, we need to prepare our heart before hearing his word. 

Second, rock-like heart. Look at verse 13. �Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.� Here rocky ground refers to a small rocky field with little soil. The rock-like heart receives the word of God with joy at first. They look very hopeful. However, even so, if they face persecution, these people start doubting God�s word and eventually fall away. They do not have any root in the word because they do not obey it. Their fundamental problem is root-less ness. Whether one has a root or not is not visible, yet at the time of difficulty or trial, their faith is revealed. When persecuted by family or friends because of their decision to live as Jesus� disciples, people can soon betray Jesus. Persecutions or hardship of these kinds � though they are painful � purify our hearts and help us to stand for the truth. Therefore, difficulties or persecutions are not the problem. They indeed help us to grow. However, the real issue is whether we have no root in the word of God. If we have a rocky heart, we can�t take deep root because of the rocks. Here rocks refer to one�s hidden ambition, dream, plan, sin, self-righteousness or unbelief. Hearts like these seek to glorify themselves and live self-centred lives. Unless they repent and live a God-centred life, God�s word can�t take a root. 

Third, thorn-like heart. Look at verse 14. �The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life�s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.� People with thorny hearts hear the word and even take root in the word. They have a clear life direction to live for God and devote themselves to do so. However, the problem is that thorns grow together with the seed. Thorns grow faster than the seed of life and eat up the seed�s nutrients. At the end, seeds are chocked by the thorns and do not mature or bear fruit. Therefore, we must get rid of the thorns. Then, what could be the thorns? 

There are thorns of worldly worries. When we devote ourselves to God and his work, Satan plants life worries in our heart � making us worried for our future security. Some worry about studies, or jobs, some their health and others worry about children. Some worry about their spiritual fruit. Such thorns distract our heart from the word of God and make us more and more worried. Gradually, our hearts become dark and we lose our joy and hope. We are entangled by our daily problems and end up living a self-centred small life. These thorns of life�s worries are used by Satan when we allow small unbelief into our hearts. In order to prevent the thorns of life growing in our hearts, we need to therefore repent of our doubt. We need to trust in God with an absolute attitude and put all things in his hands. We need to trust in him and seek first his kingdom and will.

There are also thorns of riches. This means our greed for money that originates from our desire to live a better, more comfortable life. None of us may feel that rich but we are at the stage in our lives that money can make us want to settle down. Many of us are no longer students and we can instead desire a different quality of life. We may be rich with children and homes. We don�t have to be rich to be pricked by the thorns of riches, our desire for money and a certain quality of life can smother our desire for the word.

Then there are thorns of pleasure. When we are plucked by these thorns, we lose power to struggle spiritually. We lose our desire and power to serve God.  When we are plucked by these thorns, though we try hard, we don�t receive joy or grace in our life of faith. We lose our power and easily become tired. Removing thorns is sometimes painful. So, people just live with them. Yet, if we allow the thorns in our heart to remain, we ultimately lose our spiritual power and life. All our struggles end in vain. God is not happy with us if we do not bear any fruit. The thorns of life�s worries or riches originate from our desire to live our lives with our own strength. We need to repent our pride and remove the thorns from their roots. May God renew our hearts and help us to make new decisions of faith to live for his glory only with pure heart.
Fourth, read 15 together. �But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.� The good heart is the only heart that bears fruit. People with a good heart hear and love the word of God. Acts 17 talks about the attitude of Bereans who received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. Jesus tells us three conditions are needed for a good and noble heart. 
First, Hear the word. When do we know we have heard the word, rather than it just going through one ear and out the other? When we take notice of it, when we truly value its importance, when it impacts and changes our lives. In that sense hearing leads to obedience and change. Many of us are here because in the past we heard the word. Some of you heard the word to such an extent that you left your country and families and professional lives back home to be missionaries, others of you heard the word so clearly that you committed yourselves and lives to be bible teachers and shepherds. Do you remember the times when you really heard the word? When it was so exciting that you wanted to stay up and extra hour, or you looked forward to rising early to reading it, or in the middle of the day you longed for its nourishment. Are we enjoying that relationship to the word of God now, or is it a pleasant but distant memory? Is it that our hearts are rather more hard and path like, or rocky, or so busy and distracted by worries that we simply don�t have room? Or may be others of you have never really heard the word in a way that has touched you, that has brought you into a relationship with Jesus that is very personal, where you have been changed and transformed and born again. We know when we have heard the word because of its impact on our lives. It moves us into a new and vital relationship with God. But it is not easy to hear the word. I was talking to June yesterday, she was saying how tiredness and sheer exhaustion can stop her, she knows the word�s importance but still in reality it is so difficult. There are so many reasons why we don�t hear the word, it is a spiritual battle, and the devil will do anything to prevent us from hearing it. But it is something we have to battle for, and whatever it is that is preventing us, whatever is getting in the way, it cannot be as important as hearing the words of Jesus. We need to identify what it is that is blocking me hearing the word, and then to make time, guard that time, and hear Jesus through his word, hear it so it nourishes us, inspires us to action, hear it so that it challenges us to repent, or that it so changes our character and our care and service of others. Jesus says he who has ears to hear let him hear, the battle is ours, it�s our ears. Let�s pray to hear.
Second, retain it and persevere. To retain God�s word means to not only appreciate its truth, or value, but in the course of our daily lives, call it to mind, and allow it to continue to influence us and to draw its power, even when life gets so busy, or we face some crisis, or when at the end of the day we feel low and discouraged. The word in that sense is to be held to and used, not just to be appreciated as a beautiful abstract thought. (In a bible study we can think how graceful, and yet the next day at work we have lost it in the boss�s demands or some fleeting temptation that distracts us or our child�s crying). To persevere means simply to keep going with the word. If we have been good soil in the past, and then find we have become hardened or rocky or thorny, or that we fall into old sins, we can become discouraged, and think what�s the point? We stop struggling and get weaker and weaker. Perseverance means we simply come back to Jesus and begin again and keep going! Perseverance can be underrated because it is not as exciting as inspiration. But we can�t be inspired all the time, sometimes we have to plod and grind out a time with God�s word even when we don�t feel like it. Perseverance is what puts down root. Often, we fail because of their impatience. However, to bear fruit, we need to persevere � at least 10 years! God waited 25 years for Abraham to be ready to bear the fruit. To persevere means to wait for God�s time.  
So how do we do it?  How do we hear, retain and persevere with God�s word? Well it takes time, and quality of thought. The word of God is not cheap; if we are cheap towards it we will not receive much. Here, I want to make a case for personal reflection writing again!  It is a way to think deeply, it is a way to spend time, writing helps us to remember, and each week writing and sharing is a way to persevere. It is a very effective way. But again we should ask what is the quality of my reflection, am I thinking freshly and enjoying God�s word or is it just a task to get done? Delight is important. Anyone can have a good heart. At the same time, good heart can become a bad heart if we do not struggle to maintain it. Jesus teaches us that the only way to bear much fruit is through living by the word of God only. In time Jesus promises we will bear a crop, the fruit of the Holy Spirit, and live a happy life in him, glorifying his name. 
Verses 16-18 explains the reason Jesus is giving this truth using parables. It is not to conceal but to make the word more accessible to everyone. Therefore, if we listen and consider carefully of what we hear, we will gain more. Yet, if we fail to do so, we will lose even what we already have. In verses 19-21, Jesus is teaching us that those who hear and obey the word of God are true members of his family.  Jesus welcomes and loves those who hear his words and struggle to live accordingly as his true family. May God help us to become Jesus� true family and live a blessed life by hearing his words and putting them into practice.

In conclusion, we all want to live fruitful lives that bear a crop. Jesus tells us so clearly hear the words and obey them, Jesus promises us that we will become good heart soil so that we may bear a crop a hundred times what was sown!
