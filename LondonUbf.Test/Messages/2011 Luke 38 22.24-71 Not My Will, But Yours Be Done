2011 Luke 38

NOT MY WILL, BUT YOURS BE DONE

Luke 22:24-71
Key verse: 22:42 
�Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.� 

In talking about today�s events Jesus says this is the �hour when darkness reigns� (53). It�s easy to see why: The disciples are ill prepared and baldy misunderstand what Jesus is about to do; Peter is over confident and blind to his reality; Judas will betray Jesus; and Jesus will be arrested, beaten and mocked. Throughout this time Satan is working to tempt Jesus not to take the cross. This is the hour when darkness reigns. Yet Jesus overcomes these things through prayer. Before the problems he prays and so does not fall into temptation. May we learn from Jesus and heed his warning.

I. Jesus� prayer in Gethsemane (24-44)

Look at verse 24: �Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.�  Jesus had been teaching through the last supper the meaning of his death. It�s an important time. It�s a solemn time. Yet the disciples take this opportunity to argue about who is the greatest. This is a devastating comment on the spiritual reality of the disciples. And worse still this is not even the first time they have argued about this. Luke has already told us of exactly the same dispute in chapter 9. Despite being with Jesus, despite his earlier teaching that �the greatest among you is the least� they return to the same debate about who will get the top position. The disciples were still humanistic, secular and political. Although slow to learn Jesus is patient and he again taught them who is truly great in verse 26: �Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves�. In many cultures age tends to attract respect and older people tend to expect to be served by the younger. But Jesus said that the greatest among them should be like the youngest, and the one who ruled like the one who served.  Does that sound attractive to you? As believers we know this but like the disciples we find such teaching unattractive. We want to be served rather than serve. Basically it contradicts every desire and hope we have. After working hard, we want to relax and be served. After working hard, we want recognition and honour. Yet Jesus wants them to see that true greatness is found in serving. How can we serve like this? 

Look at verses 28-30: �You are those who have stood by me in my trials. And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.� He declares, �I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me.� Jesus was looking forward to a reward. It was not recognition from sinful men. It was the recognition of his Father God. He trusted that by serving God�s will for his life on earth, he would receive a kingdom of peace, love and joy in heaven. But amazingly he promised the same reward to his young disciples. Although they were weak and would abandon him Jesus gave them an incredibly generous blessing. He assured them they could freely serve others as Jesus� disciples on earth, because they had a place with him in his kingdom forever, after their service on earth was done. Likewise, Jesus assures us that when we use our Christian freedom to serve others, it is with the confidence that the glory we will receive is not worth comparing to the sufferings our service involves. 

This is a tempting time for Jesus. The disciples are weak and Jesus could be tempted to think that he has to stay longer with his disciples as they are simply not ready to live without Jesus. But instead he prepares them for what will happen and prays. Look at verses 31-32: �Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers�.  

This is a mysterious verse. Jesus lifts the veil to reveal a spiritual reality: �Satan has asked to sift you as wheat�. The devil has somehow approached God and asked if he can try and get Peter. To sift wheat is to throw it in the air and violently mix it about to remove the chaff. This is similar to Job Ch 1 in which the devil approaches God and asked if he could challenge Job�s faith.  The devil�s accusation is that Job only has faith simply because God has blessed him and put a hedge around him (Job 1:9). The devil�s attack is that if life was hard he would lose faith. Following this Job faced a series of tests yet maintained his faith.  Likewise Peter would soon face Satan�s attack. When tough things happen in life people sometimes blame God but we must know that in life there is God, us and the devil. Peter will soon face attack from Satan. Notice that Jesus does not stop the devil. Jesus does not say �Satan has asked to sift you as wheat and I said no�. Likewise for us there are times when the devil attacks. There are times when our lives seem like they are violently thrown around, we are blown and buffeted by problems. Jesus does not necessarily stop this but he does help. 

Firstly notice in verse 32a: �I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith my not fail you.� How does he help? Jesus prays for his disciples. It is not that Jesus died for us, rose again and then walked away. Rather Jesus prays for us. He is whispering into the Father�s ear, �Keep her from sin.  Keep him from breaking, Lord.  Keep their faith from failing, Lord.  Bring them to repentance, Lord.�  As Hebrews says �he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.� (Heb 7:25). This matters. Sometimes we feel like our prayers are not working.  We can feel like the heavens are made of brass and our prayers are not heard. Sometimes we feel hindered and discouraged. Sometimes we don�t even pray. But here we see that Jesus prays for us. Jesus prayers are powerful and effective. Notice in verse 32 Jesus says �when you have turned back� not �if you turn back�. There is no doubt in Jesus mind that Peter will fail but he will also turn back. Jesus prayer is what sustains and keeps Peter and what sustains and keeps us.  

Second we see the use of such testing. Frankly it sounds scary that the devil might try and sift us and shake us up. If the devil has to ask permission to test us and if Jesus prayer is so powerful then why does this even have to happen? Look at verse 32b, �And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers�. Peter would fail but in knowing the grace of Jesus he would be able to be used to strengthen his brothers. Peter would be able to tell people that how, despite his sin, Jesus changed his heart and restored him. He would become the rock of the early church not because he was himself unbreakable but because he knew the depths of the grace of God. In the week Darren and I say a short video of a short testimony by a singer called Lecrae. It�s called �I am second�. He tells of how he was involved in drugs and gangs. No father or role models in life, he longed for significance. At the lowest point he heard someone ask �do you know you were bought at a price?� And through this he realised that he was significant enough for Jesus to die for him. This word broke through and he met Jesus through it. His testimony of how he came to faith is incredibly strengthening and now he speaks in prisons and to people who were like him about what Jesus has done. In short he can strengthen his brothers because of his past and what Jesus has done. 

How does Peter respond to Jesus help?  Look at verse 33, �But he replied, �Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death��. Peter did not receive Jesus� words of warning. He did not see the spiritual reality and accept Jesus warnings. Rather, his pride was hurt and he confidently defended himself.  But he was wrong. Jesus told him, �I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.� (34)
 
Jesus continues to help them and show the disciples what they need to do at this time of crisis.  Look at verse 39: �Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him�. We know from other gospel accounts that Jesus went to a particular garden on the Mount of Olives were where he prayed. �As usual� tells us that this was part of his life and it seems that each evening Jesus would come to the quiet garden of Gethsemane to pray. But this time it was different. Commentators say that what took place in the garden contains depths that we can never understand. Others have said it is holy ground because in it we get a glimpse of the huge spiritual struggle and agony taking place before the cross. 

How should we face times of testing and trouble? In short we should pray. In this we see three key things of triumphant prayer. 

First anticipation. Look at verse 40: �On reaching the place, he said to them, �Pray that you will not fall into temptation.�� Even though Jesus would be crucified within hours Jesus was concerned about his disciples and wanted to help them. In fact so important is this point that Jesus repeats himself in verse 46, �Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation�.  Jesus is giving a clear warning that in our Christian life anyone can fall into temptation if he does not pray. 


All people are sinners. But even as believers the problem of sin remains in that we still struggle with temptation because of our sinful unholy flesh. Though we may be forgiven and new in Christ, we are like Lazarus who Jesus brought out of the tomb. We came out of the grave, we have new life but we stink. We have our dirty grave clothes on. Satan�s temptation to us is to hold on to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. Spurgeon gives a rather unpleasant description of how ancient tyrants would sometimes punish a person. They would tie a dead body to him so that they were back to back. The man would be forced to carry the dead person with them wherever he went. The result is that the dead carcass would rot and become corrupt and could infect and even kill the living person. This is a picture of our sinful nature that despite having new life can still infect us even though we may believe and have life from Jesus.  We struggle because the power of evil is so strong in us. 

The answer as Jesus repeats is �pray so that you will not fall into temptation�. No one wants to fall into temptation as a disciple. Peter did not. The disciples did not. But though we do not want to fall into temptation, it does not mean that we will not be tempted. Satan prowls around looking for those to devour. He does not take holidays. If we fall into temptation, we cannot escape through our own strength, effort and will power. What Jesus wanted his disciples to do was anticipate and admit their weaknesses. He wanted them to know that they could not withstand Satan�s temptation without God�s help. So Jesus commanded his disciples �pray so that they might not fall into temptation�. We must anticipate the reality. When people fall chances are they have not been praying.

The second feature of his prayer is submission. Look at verse 42: �Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.� Take this cup from me. Jesus knew the agony that was ahead. The reference to a cup refers back to the Old Testament that speaks of the cup of God�s wrath (Isa 52.17). This was the cup of being despised, of being mocked, of being killed and ultimately of taking the sin of the world. Jesus, as a man, did not want to drink the cup of the cross. So he prayed �take this cup from me�. Yet the key thing is that Jesus� prayer did not stop there. He wanted God�s will be done and prayed �yet not my will but yours be done�. This is the battle in prayer. I heard a story of a church that had a particularly prayerful man. They would send him to hospital visits, to people�s death beds or whenever there were difficulties to pray with people.  He saw real suffering and people would ask him �please pray for healing� �please pray for this or that�. Over 25 years however many said to him �But don�t say �your will be done� � that�s God�s escape clause�. 

It sounds quite funny but in truth this is the battle of prayer. It�s the great struggle we all face. We are tempted to think that the thing that will give us most satisfaction is the thing that God has told us not to do.  And Satan tells us the only way to get satisfaction is to do our will, not God�s.  What God asks sometimes seems hard to us �No, Lord, I can�t forgive her. No, Lord, I can�t love him; Lord, I can�t go to UCL, I can�t tell that person about Jesus� The great battle is to say, �yet not my will but yours be done�. It was a ferocious battle yet while praying Jesus denied the desire of the body and obeyed the will of God. Likewise for us we need this great turning point. While insisting on our own will, we cannot do God�s will.   We know that we have to obey God�s will yet we do have strength to do so. It means we have to pray.

So we need to anticipate the reality; we need to submit to God�s will. The third mark of triumphant prayer is restoration. Look at verse 43: �An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him�. Jesus wrestled to accept God�s will and that time, an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. Only Luke tell us of this event and in a way lifts the lid on a secret of prayer. When we pray God gives strength and encourages. Through prayer God restores us. When we don�t pray, even though we may know God�s will we cannot obey it because we do not have the power to do so. Through prayer Jesus received strength. Verse 45 show�s us the victory � �when he rose from prayer�. There is no statement about the triumph but it�s evident. Jesus rose and could face what was ahead with power. In contrast the disciples lacked power and could not face what was ahead. 

II. Jesus arrested (45-71) 

The events that now follow are a playing out of what Jesus has said. In verses 47-53 we read of Jesus� arrest. While still talking to them a crowd came up and Judas was leading them. Judas approached Jesus and kissed him as a sign to those following. Judas kiss was the kiss of betrayal. It�s at this point that the disciples seem to wake up and start throwing their swords around. In the midst of doing it, Peter cut the ear of a servant of high priest, Malchus (Jn 18.10). As verse 51 shows Jesus stopped them, touched the man�s ear and healed him. This was the last act that his hands did before being bound.

There is something here that is important for us to learn. J.C. Ryle points out �it is much easier to fight a little for Christ than to endure hardship and go to prison and death for His sake� Crusaders will always be found more numerous than martyrs.� By this he meant it�s easy in the excitement to throw the sword around but far harder to suffer patiently for Christ. Sadly many start with enthusiasm, start with excitement and things seem to happen. But it does last when things get hard. Peter, did far less good when he drew his sword and cut off a man�s ear than when he stood calmly before the ruling council as a prisoner and said, �I cannot help speaking about what I have seen and heard." (Ac 4:20). The sword is easier than suffering but far less fruitful. 

Lastly in verses 54-62 we see the failure of Peter. Unlike Jesus he had not prayed and he was not prepared for what would happen. The results are tragic. Look at verse 54, �Then seizing him they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance�. Thinking of his position as the top disciple and conscience as a believer, he could not ignore Jesus. He had said that he was ready to go with Jesus to prison and to death and he meant it. But it was not possible to be with Jesus and he was only able to follow at a distance. Following Jesus, Peter entered the courtyard where people had kindled a fire. Peter sat down with them. In verse 56 we read �a servant girl saw him and said, �This man was with him��. There was no real risk toward Peter. This was just a girl and it was not a crime to be a Galilean or even to be with Jesus. But when fear was in his heart Satan used this as a hook to lead to greater sin. This is the way the devil works. A small fear, a small sin is used as a leaver to break us away from Christ. With fear in his heart he said, �Woman, I don�t know him� (57).  A little later someone else saw him said, �You also are one of them.� But Peter replied, �Man, I am not!� About an hour later another said, �Certainly this fellow was with him for his is a Galilean.� (59). Again Peter denied Jesus, �Man, I don�t know what you�re talking about!� (60) Just as he was speaking, the cock crowed. 

Thinking of Peter we see clearly the consequences of not praying. He shows us that if we face temptation in our own strength we will lose. We know this. But the point that strikes is the grace of Jesus towards Peter. Do you know what is the difference between Peter and Judas?  Luke tells us in verse 61: The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the cock crows today, you will disown me three times." Right as Peter is denying Jesus for the third time, we are told that �Jesus turned and looked straight at Peter.�  

The difference between Peter and Judas can be traced to that look.  It was not something different in Peter. Rather it was something about what the Saviour did for Peter.  He looked at him, and in that look reminded him of the word.  We tend to think that Peter repented and that makes him better than Judas. Deep down we think �yes but Peter loved Jesus whereas Judas did not�. But that glance is the difference between Peter ending up like Judas and Peter being restored.  In the end the difference between you and me and the difference between you and me and those who do not repent, is not that we are better; it�s that Jesus has shown us His infinite mercy.   This matters. It shows that Jesus is the one that keeps us. Jesus is the one that not only saves us when we put our trust in him but he is the one that continues to pray for us and continues to look at us and keep us. The truth is if I could lose my faith I would lose my faith. It is the continual grace of Jesus that keeps us. Lastly Jesus is arrested and beaten and taken away for trial. 

In conclusion, there is a fierce spiritual battle raging. The devil prowls around like a roaring lion. Jesus tells us �pray that you will not fall into temptation�. He shows us how to pray that we pray to accept God�s good will for our lives. When we pray we find strength and can stand. When we don�t pray like Peter, we fall.  I pray we may find strength in Jesus and live the will of God to His glory.
