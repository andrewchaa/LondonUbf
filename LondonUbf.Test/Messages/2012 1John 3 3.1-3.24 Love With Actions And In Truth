LOVE WITH ACTIONS AND IN TRUTH

1 John 3:1-24
Key verse 3:18 
Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.

We have already heard that john is writing this letter to believers at a time when Gnoticism was influencing the church. That caused confusion amongst believers as to what it meant to be a Christian. In today’s passage, John plants in the believers the identity that they are children of God. He does so by explaining how it is that we can be sure that we are Children of god. First through our attitude to sin, and secondly through our love for our brother. Through today’s message, may God help us to accept our spiritual identity as children of God.

Part I. Jesus takes away our sins

Look at verse 1. “How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him” It is an incredible gift from God that we are called children of God. Yet, the world doesn’t know us because it didn’t know him. This verse reflects the spiritual atmosphere of the time. Gnostics often argued that those who believed in Jesus were not true Christians but only they themselves were. John is saying that they argue like this because of they do not know God. We don’t need to think too much about what others say about us. We need only to remember how great the love we have received is; how much our inner self has been changed and what a great and amazing blessing it is to be children of God. Only those who have experienced this amazing blessing of being God’s children can also realise how great God’s love is for us. 

Look at verse 2. “Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.” We now have become children of God and live with this great privilege as his children. We now can call God as our Abba Father. We have an intimate relationship with him and are loved by him. However, we don’t know so well what our future will be like. One thing we know is that when Jesus comes again, we – children of God will all become like him. On that day, God will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body (Phil 3:21). Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror but on that day we will see all and see him face to face – (1Co 13:12) all things will be crystal clear. 

Then, as those who have hope in Jesus’ second coming, as those who have been loved by God so much – how should we live? Look at verse 3. “Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure.” Because of the hope we have in him, we can live a pure life following Jesus’ example.

Look at verse 4. “Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.” Gnostics argued that they were sinless and didn’t break laws. 1John 1:1-10 regarded such people who claimed to be without sin to be making God a liar. Another group of people argued that sinning is not related to one’s salvation. However, Apostle John clearly says, “Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.” What is breaking law? It is to break the law of God. There are two types of God’s law: one is don’t and the other is do.

God says don’t murder, don’t be adulterous, don’t steal. If one does these things, they are law breakers. Also, God says do worship God, do keep the Sabbath, do honour parents. If one doesn’t do these, they are also lawbreakers. God commanded that the consequence of breaking certain of these laws was death. Committing sin is breaking the law and sin leads to death.

Why do people break laws? Are there no laws? God clearly gave us laws. But, many people live according to their own laws and ignore God’s laws. However, Jesus came in order to make us sinless. Look at verse 5. “But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin.” Jesus is sinless. He came into this world with a physical body yet he is sinless. He had a physical body like us and was also tempted by the devil. However, he overcame sin and lived without sin. For this reason, he could take away our sins by being condemned in our place by God. Through him, we are redeemed from all the curses of the law.

Look at verse 6. “No-one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No-one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.” 1 John 1-10 says that those who claim to be without sins are liars. And 1 John 2:1 says that even if we sin, Jesus is right there to redeem us. This means that even if we are Christians, we are vulnerable to sins but when we commit sins, Jesus redeems us. Then, what does verse 6 mean?  “No-one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No-one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.” Here ‘to keep on sinning’ means to sin continually, habitually and without remorse or conviction. People who have not been born again nor known Christ personally can do this. When we know the love of Christ on the cross, we won’t keep on sinning. The reason is though we might sin through weakness, yet our conscience is convicted to repent and when we repent, we struggle to bear the fruit of repentance. Apostle John is warning the Gnostics through this verse, who argued that they were children of God, while continuing to sin as they liked. He is telling the believers that it is impossible for children of God to keep on sinning like Gnostics. That is, Christians Children of God hate sin and desire to be free from sin and repent sincerely when they sin.

Look at verse 7a. “Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray.” Again, Gnostics argued that knowing God is mysterious so only those who understood this mystery through their esoteric knowledge could become children of God and be freed from their earthly body. Their teaching often deceived believers. Apostle John however clearly says, “who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work.” Children of God have desire to live righteous lives and imitate Jesus’ righteousness. However, the children of the devil keep on sinning and live in sin. The devil indeed sinned from the very beginning. Adam and Even committed sins because of him. From that time, sin came into the world and people lived as slaves of sins (Heb 2:15). God knew that we can never be free from our sins in our own strength. So, he promised to send a messiah (Gen 3:15). And he sent Jesus as our Saviour fulfilling his promise. Jesus destroyed the devil completely by dying on the cross and freed us from the power of death. 

Look at verse 9. “No-one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.” The reason why children of God do not sin is because we have the seeds of God in us and we have been born of God.  St. Augustine says here seed means the word of God (Psalm 119:11, Jeremiah 31:33). Because the word of God is planted in our hearts, we can’t keep on sinning. Those who have the message of the cross in their hearts can’t continue sinning because the message helps them repent and be free from the power of sin. The word of God is living and active. It is sharer than a double-edged sword. When the word of God is planted in our hearts, we have a strong desire to live according to the word of God. The devil is eager therefore to steal the word of God from our heart. Therefore, we need to struggle to maintain the word of God in our heart.

Calvin said that the seed can also mean the Holy Spirit (Rom 8:11, 1Cor 3:16). Because the Holy Spirit is in our hearts, we can’t keep on sinning. Paul said that if we do not have the Holy Spirit – the Spirit of Jesus, we are not true Christians. The Holy Spirit is the spirit of truth. He always works in our heart with the words of truth. When a child of God sins, the Holy Spirit helps him to realise his sins and leads him to repent. However, those who do not have Holy Spirit in them don’t repent. This is the clear difference between children of God and children of devil. Look at verse 10. “This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God; nor is anyone who does not love his brother.” Children of devil continually sin and hate brothers. However, the children of God desire righteousness and love their brothers. 

Part II. Love with actions in truth

Look at verse 11. “This is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another.” This means to love continually. Love one another is Jesus’ new command. (John 15:12,17). From Genesis to Revelation, this command is repeated. It is also the command we received from the day when we first became children of God, born again. To love one another is a phrase that John repeats throughout this letter and we will look at it in more detail next week. But it suggests a love that streches beyond what is naturally human self-centred love to an understanding of God’s sacrificial love. Yet John almost immediately talks about the opposite of this love. Look at verse 12. “Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother's were righteous.” Just as there is the Spirit of god in love so0 there is the spirit of the devil which is hatred and murder. Cain should have repented when his sins were revealed. However, instead, he murdered his brother. This shows that Cain belonged to the devil. People who belonged to the devil do not repent but instead want to kill those who are righteous when their sins are exposed. Religious leaders and Jews in Jesus time had the same problem. Their sins were exposed because of Jesus so they hated him and wanted to kill him. 

Apostle John went on and said in verse 13 “Do not be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.” The world belongs to the devil, so it hates the children of God because their deeds are evil but the deeds of God’s children are righteous. The spiritual reality is that the example of the children of God works to expose the sin of the world, whether actively through the word or simply ‘the smell of the gospel’ which testifies against it. Look at verse 14. “We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death.” Here ‘we’ refers to the children of God and the tense of this verse is present perfect – this means that as soon as Christians believe in Jesus, at that very moment, we have already passed from death to life. Then, how can we know? How can we be confident of this grace? John tells us that this becomes obvious when we love our brothers. Those who have passed from death to life can’t but love their brothers. 

Before defining further how this new Godly love is recognized, John reminds us again that it is opposite to the spirit of the world and the devil. Look at verse 15.  “Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him.” John says that anyone who hates his brother is a murderer. Last week we talked of hatred as being both active and passive, that it is possible to murder through indifference, coldness and absence of love as well as active hatred and resentment. John wants to make clear the difference between the love of God and the hatred of the devil. 

Look at verse 16. “This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.” Jesus gave up his own life in order to save God’s chosen people. (John 10:15,17) Jesus’ sacrifice brought us forgiveness of sins and salvation. Through this, we learned what love is – this love is unconditional love and love that forgives our enemy. This is called agape. Jesus loved us with a sacrificial love and it is through this love, we came to true repentance. 

From verse 17 onwards John tells us how we should love our brothers. First very practically Look at verse 17. “If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?” God did not give us material possessions for ourselves alone. God wants us to help our needy brothers when we see their needs. If we ignore our brothers’ needs, we can’t say we love God.  

Second with action and truth. Look at verse 18. “Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.” Love with words alone is empty and false love. How then should we love? We should not love with words and tongue alone. Of course, we need to use our tongue in loving others.* However, we need to love with actions. Otherwise, it can’t be true love. God didn’t just love us with empty words. He sent his only son as his expression of love for us. Actions can be anything, a thoughtful present, an evening of care and time spent listening, to someone in need.* Missionaries here acted when they gave up their futures in Korea to live amongst British students. Outreach can seem difficult, it can seem at times fruitless if we are met by deaf ears, but it is an act of love to bring students the gospel, as is giving time up to study with people or even our homes in common life. True love in that sense is accompanied by sacrifice.

When we love, we also need to live in truth. Our action of love needs to come with truth in our heart. It is hard to love with truth, particularly when society drifts further and further away from the standard of God’s word. To teach the Bible is a spiritual struggle, that involves much prayer and patience, it takes the risk of being misunderstood and hurt and discouraged that God’s truth can take root in a person’s heart. Truth in John’s time was contested by the Gnostics, in our day we have our own Gnostics. On radio 4 in programmes like start the week we have so called experts in religion supposedly speak from their expertise, but it certainly isn’t the gospel truth. To love with action and truth above all demands we move beyond theory to prayer and service. Someone I heard recently described learning such love as like swimming, one cannot learn to swim by reading a book but by practicing in the pool. When we love with action and truth, whether our bible students co-workers or friends our brothers can smell the love and be encouraged and strengthened.

Look at verses 19-20. “This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence whenever our hearts condemn us. For God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.” When we love our brothers with action and truth, this will testify that we belong to the truth. Our heart will also be strengthened too.

Look at verses 21-22. “Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him.” When we love our brothers with action and truth, we will also become confident before God and courageous to ask him anything. Our relationship with God will become intimate and we will experience how God answers our prayer.

Look at verse 23. “And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us.” There are two main commands: one is to believe in the name of his son, Jesus Christ and the other is to love one another. The first command is to believe in God’s redemptive work that has been done through Jesus’ sacrifice once and for all. Here the name means everything about Jesus. When we believe in the name of Jesus Christ, it means that we need to accept everything about Jesus. By believing and accepting Jesus’ name, we become children of God and our relationship with God is restored. This faith also gives us power to continue to live as children of God. The second command implies continuity – we need to love one another continually. Jesus says in John 13:34, “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.” We need to love our brothers as we have been loved by Jesus. When we love our brothers with this love, the world will know that we are his disciples.

When we obey these two commands, that is when we believe in Jesus and love one another, God will be pleased and answer all our prayers. 
Look at verse 24. “Those who obey his commands live in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us.” When we believe in Jesus and love our brother, we will be also blessed to have an intimate relationship with Jesus. We will become one with Jesus – he will be in us and we will be in him. We can be assured of this by the Holy Spirit who lives in us. It is also the Holy Spirit who helps us to confess Jesus as our Saviour and also enables us to love others. (1John 4:13, Gal 5:16,22) It is impossible for us to do without the help of Holy Spirit who lives in us. 

In conclusion, we can and need to love our brothers because Jesus died for us. When we love our brothers, we need to do so with action and truth. When we love our brothers in this way, God will bless us. May God help us to love brothers with the love of Jesus and be blessed by him and have a deeper fellowship with him.
