2011 Luke 15


YOU GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO EAT

Luke 9:1-17
Key verse 9:13
�He replied, �You give them something to eat.��

There are two parts to today�s message. In the first part Jesus sends out his apostles on a missionary journey to train them as evangelists. These 12 men had heard Jesus teach and seen him perform miracles but now they were going out to do the things Jesus had done. In the second part of the passage they are tested by Jesus� challenge; �You give them something to eat.� They have the opportunity to apply the lessons about compassion and faith and take responsibility. As Christians we are called to preach the kingdom of God and bring people to eternal life. I pray that we would learn from the apostles� experience to take responsibility by growing in compassion for the lost souls of this generation and to having faith that Jesus will change this nation and bring many people into the kingdom of God.

Part 1: Jesus sends out the twelve

Look at verses 1 and 2 �When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.� The twelve apostles had heard Jesus preaching to the crowds. They had heard the parable of the sower and the story of the man building on rock. They had seen Jesus heal people, calm a storm, cast the demons out of the demon possessed man and then raise a girl from the dead. The disciples could have got an A* in an exam on Jesus� teaching and miracles. They would have thought they were the best prepared evangelists in the world. But learning is not just about what we read and see other people do. In reality the deepest learning often comes from experience. When I was at school I studied French for ten years. I thought I was pretty good so I went to work in France. When I arrived I realised that no one understood anything I said and I was really disappointed. Yet after being there for sixth months I had learned more than I had in the whole of the ten years beforehand. The same thing was true for the apostles. They knew a lot in their heads but now they had to learn through experience. Jesus was preparing them for a time when he would no longer be there and they would be responsible for preaching the gospel to the whole world. 

Jesus told them they would have power to do amazing things; casting out demons, healing the sick and curing diseases. But verse 2 tells us that the focus of their training was to; ��preach the kingdom of God�� Jesus healed people and raised people from the dead because he had compassion on these people and wanted to end their suffering. In this way he revealed his power. But these things are only temporary. All the people Jesus healed died and would face judgement for their sin. What they really needed the kingdom of God

We may that the kingdom of God about what happens to us when we die and this true. But the reality is that people living without the kingdom of God today live lives of stress, fear, worry and hatred. There is only one solution and that is to repent, accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and enter the kingdom of God. When we receive the kingdom of God, we receive all the blessings of the kingdom immediately. Paul talks about the fruit of the Spirit; ��love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.� When the apostles preached the kingdom of God they were changing people�s lives for eternity but at the same time they were bringing people immediate change, joy, peace and new life. 

In verse 3 Jesus told the apostles how they should go; �He told them: Take nothing for the journey� no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic.� If we are going on a journey we generally pack a big suitcase of things we need. When Hannah moved to London she sent a whole suitcase of lock �n� lock to store food in. Whenever I travel I have to take a bag of special gluten free bread. Darren always takes his ear plugs in case he has to share a room with someone who snores. Yet when Jesus sent out the apostles he told them to take nothing. Why, because he wanted them to learn to depend only on God. 

If they went out with all these things then they could have relied on and hidden behind them. For instance if they had money they could have paid for somewhere to sleep at night but without money they would have to allow God to lead them to the best place to sleep and this would give them great opportunities to speak to new people about Jesus. By depending on God the disciples would become humble. We see this principle in outreach when we go to UCL. We could go with many things; leaflets, signs, even a loudspeaker so that everyone could hear us. But if we have these things we can easily come to rely on them. By going with only the word of God though we have to talk to people and rely on God to give us the correct words. When we have faith in God we see him really change people�s lives because he is working through us to change people.  

This was the case with Jesus� instruction to them about where they had to stay. Look at verse 4; �Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.� Staying the homes of the people they met could have been awkward so the apostles might have tried to move house every day in order that they would not be a burden on people. But Jesus wanted them to stay in the same house. This meant that they could spend several days eating, talking with and preaching to the people of the house. By the time they left the people in that house would have learned very deeply about the kingdom of God and been ready to tell other people. In this way the apostles would plant churches and raise evangelists to preach in the villages. Our temptation may be to talk to as many people as possible about the gospel but Jesus wants us to serve one person faithfully until they have accepted the word of God then that person can go and share it with other people. 

Verses 5 to 9 tell us about the consequences of what happened when the apostles preached the word of God. In verse 5 Jesus instructed the apostles that if a town did not welcome them they were to shake the dust off their feet when they left the town, as a testimony against them. This referred to a Jewish custom of shaking the dust off their clothes as they left Gentile territory as a sign of God�s judgement. The apostles were now to do the same thing in Israel as a sign that we enter the kingdom of God only through faith in Jesus. 
 
Verse 6 goes on to describe the success of the apostles� journey. They went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere. They would have rejoiced to see God working and people�s lives being changed. The nature of the word of God is that it convicts us of sin. Those people who were convicted and repented would have received forgiveness and been very joyful. However those who rejected the apostles would have been perplexed like Herod was because they knew their sin and had to carry their guilt. We must be clear about the effects of the word of God. Either it will lead us to the kingdom of God or, if we reject Jesus, we reject the peace and joy which comes from receiving the kingdom of God for today and all eternity. 

Part 2: You give them something to eat

Look at verse 10; �When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida.� We can imagine how excited the apostles were when they returned to Jesus after their mission trip. All of them had seen amazing things; demons had run from them, sick people had become well and people who lived meaningless and depressed lives found great joy when they accepted the kingdom of God. This was a time of spiritual victory but it was also a time of spiritual danger. When we have had great spiritual victories we can easily become proud and think we have done something great. Verse 10 says that the apostles were excited because of what ��they had done,� but in reality God had done great things through them and this was a time to thank God.

Jesus was aware of this danger. Verse 11 tells us that he took them to Bethsaida for a retreat and a debriefing. The disciples must have been so pleased. Finally they would be able to relax and let Jesus serve them again. But things did not turn out the way they imagined. Look at verse 11; ��but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.� This was the last thing the apostles wanted. They had done what Jesus had told them to do and served people during their mission trips but that time was over and they had no heart to serve any more. But what was Jesus� reaction. Look at verse 11 again; �He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God�. 
Jesus had compassion on the crowd and served them. Jesus saw their suffering and wanted to heal the people and give them the peace and joy of the kingdom of God.  

The apostles watched but as the day wore on they must have begun to wonder if they would ever get Jesus to themselves. Look at verse 12; �Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, �Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.�� Maybe the disciples had compassion for the crowd probably they just wanted the people to go away. Verse 14 tells us that there were 5000 men there and if they had brought their wives and children this could have been a crowd of 20000 people. Unlike Jesus the apostles had no compassion for them nor did they believe that it was possible to do anything for them. But Jesus challenged them, look at verse 13a; �He replied, �You give them something to eat��.

From the apostles perspective this made things much worse. Not only did Jesus want the people to stay and eat, Jesus said; �You give them something to eat�. Jesus wanted the apostles to take responsibility for feeding them. The apostles must have felt panic in their hearts. They had no food or money to help these people with. When they looked they found only 5 loaves of bread and two fish. They said to Jesus; �We have only five loaves of bread and two fish� unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.� 

The apostles� thought they were off duty but this was also a part of their training. Jesus wanted them to learn to take responsibility for people. The word responsibility can sound dutiful. When we think of responsibility we think of what we have to do. Maybe we think of going to work, or paying tax, things we have to do even though we don�t like them. But in order to feed people with the word of God we, like the apostles, need a true sense of responsibility which is rooted love and faith. 

John tells us that; ��we love God because he first loved us� (1 John 4:19). Before we met Jesus we all suffered. Many of us were miserable, depressed, enslaved to alcohol, involved in bad relationships or unable to speak to our families. But Jesus loved us and called into his kingdom and we received true freedom, peace and joy. We became adopted sons and daughters of God and therefore we need to share the love our Father has for his lost children.   

When we meet people who don�t know Jesus we can be put off because they look wealthy and healthy, they speak well and seem to have good lives. But in reality they are suffering from the same sense of loss and darkness we suffered from. Like us they also need the love of God and the great news is that we have it and can give it to them. Therefore our sense of responsibility must be rooted both in our love for and gratitude to Jesus and our compassion for people who are suffering as we suffered. We can grow in this sense of compassion simply by serving one person at a time just as the apostles served one house at a time on their mission trip. In our ministry we are called to serve one person at a time with the word of God. When we do this we come to know them, to have compassion on them and to love them. Through serving one person we come to have a heart which can serve many.  

The second part of taking responsibility is faith. Even if the apostles did have compassion for these people it was impossible for them to feed 5000 people with only five loaves and two fish. Practically they were right to say that Jesus should send the people away. But this was just days after they had returned from their mission journeys. They had forgotten all the amazing things which had been done through them just last week. They had forgotten all the incredible things they had seen Jesus do since he called them. The apostles were approaching this situation as if nothing had happened but Jesus wanted them to bring everything they had learned to this situation and feed the crowd by faith. All they could do was make an excuse saying was; �We have only five loaves of bread and two fish...�

By now the apostles should have learned to trust Jesus. This is fundamental to the whole Bible. God was teaching the Israelites to trust in him in the desert. He also trains us to trust in him through the challenges we face. We may say to Jesus that we would like to help but we have nothing. We make excuses. We say we lack time, Bible knowledge or English, we say have no money or that our house is not nice enough to serve people. But this is just making excuses as the apostles did. In reality they had the solution to the problem; five loaves and two fish. They saw it as an excuse but when they gave it to Jesus he used it to solve the problem. Look at verses 14 to 16; �(About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, �Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.� The disciples did so, and everybody sat down. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people.� 

When the apostles gave Jesus the little they had he multiplied it to feed thousands of people. When the apostles tried to work in their own strength they were completely powerless but when they became obedient to Jesus everything changed. Jesus made the apostles into shepherds for the crowd, telling them to get the people to sit down. Then he took the loaves and the fish, he blessed them and he broke them. Then the apostles distributed them for the people to eat. Verse 17 says; �They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.� We see that when the disciples worked in obedience to Jesus everyone was blessed with twelve baskets of food left over. Just like when they had gone out on their mission trips they learned that when they gave their hearts and what they had to Jesus he used his power to make an extraordinary miracle and feed a crowd of 5,000 men. 

This is the formula for our lives as well. Like the apostles we need to love people and have compassion on them.  We need to ask ourselves about those things we see as excuses, is this what Jesus wants me to give him? And then by faith we need to trust Jesus to use this to change people�s lives through us. Like the disciples we forget what we have already seen. All of us have seen our own lives changed by the word of God. We have also seen the lives of people around us changed by the word of God. Over the years many people who studied the Bible with us have come to believe in Jesus. Many Bible students have come from other countries and found grace from living with and studying with us. When we have had love for them and faith in Jesus� power we have seen God change people�s lives through us. 

Today we pray for UCL, we pray for the universities of the UK and we pray for thousands of people to be raised as Bible teachers for this country. Yet like the apostles we become fatalistic because the number looks too great. We think that serving one or two people is OK but changing the lives of thousands is impossible. The number is not the important thing though. What is important is that we love people and have faith in God. The apostles looked at the size of the crowd and forgetting what had happened when they had served one person very well. Yet when they trusted Jesus he fed everyone. In the same way Jesus wants to change the lives of students across the UK. He wants to use us. He simply asks us to love one person with the love of God, bring what we have to Jesus and have faith in him then we will see abundant blessing in the lives of many people.   

In conclusion. Jesus came to bring the good news of the kingdom of God and change people�s lives now and for eternity. Jesus loves all people and he wants us to go out to the world and preach the kingdom of God so that they may be saved. To do this we need compassion for lost souls and faith that Jesus will change them. So let�s bring what little we have to Jesus and trust him to use it to bring the kingdom of God to the hearts of the people of this generation.
