2011 Luke 14 

DON�T BE AFRAID; JUST BELIEVE

Luke 8:40-56
Key verse 8:50 
Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, �Don�t be afraid; just believe, and she will be hea	led.�

Today�s passage is about two interlinked miracles: a woman who suffered from bleeding and was healed after 12 years; and Jairus� 12 year old daughter who was resurrected from death by Jesus. Both received life. Both were saved by faith in Jesus� love and power. It�s a graceful unforgettable account. Through it may we learn faith in Jesus who has power over death. 
   
I. Daughter, your faith has healed you (40-48)

Look at verse 40: �Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.�  When Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him. Jesus had gone with his disciples to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, to the region of the Gerasenes in Gentile territory. Having healed one man at the price of a herd of pigs the people from the Gerasenes became afraid of what Jesus would do to them and wanted him gone. In contrast the people of Galilee were waiting for him! A crowd gathered so quickly that the people nearly crushed Jesus. There were many who had problems and were looking for Jesus� help. This was usual. But in verse 41 we read the startling thing that one of them was Jairus, a synagogue ruler. When he saw Jesus, he fell as Jesus� feet and pleaded with him to come to house.  This is a remarkable scene. Jairus is a ruler of the synagogue. That�s as high as you can go in the local community. He was an important figure responsible for the administration in the synagogue, the local centre of Judaism. He arranged all public services, appointed all teachers and readers. We know it was a large synagogue for the area and as such it would be connected to the Pharisees and teachers of the law who hated Jesus. They despised Jesus� message and were already plotting to kill him. That�s why it is so surprising. Yet all religious battles aside, he has been reduced to a grief stricken father. His only daughter was sick. I�ve come to know how precious a daughter is through my own daughter Anna. She likes to hug and is hugely tactile and loving. She is cute and inquisitive and more than able to capture Daddy�s heart. For Jairus his world has collapsed. He fell at Jesus� feet and pleaded with him to come to his house. He no longer cared about his religious connections. He no longer cared what some Pharisee or teacher of the law might think. All he cares about is that he gets Jesus to his daughter. 


And Jesus responded to Jairus. He went with him � that is grace. Yet as they were on their way, the crowds almost crushed him. Look at verses 43-44: �And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.� It seems that as he moved forward people weren�t willing to move out the way and taking advantage of the traffic jam, this woman came up from behind in the crush of people just to touch the edge of Jesus� cloak. So pausing there, what an immediate contrast there is between these two people: One is a man, one is a woman. One is rich, one is poor. One is revered and exalted; one is rejected.  One is used to being honoured; one is used to being scorned. One has a twelve-year-old daughter dying, and the other has a twelve-year-old disease. One leads the synagogue, and the other is excommunicated from the synagogue. And here we see Jesus embracing both extremes. Jesus has room for both. He embraces all.

This woman was sick with blood loss. By God�s strange providence I�ve seen something of this recently as last week Joanna was in hospital because of serious blood loss. It was a difficult time although not 12 years of suffering.  I saw something of this in hospital in the bed opposite: There was a woman, perhaps of similar age, who had suffered most of her life with a blood problem of sickle cell anaemia. She was painfully thin. She could only walk slowly and in pain. Over the years the illness had caused her to vomit repeatedly until the acid had burnt away much of her throat so that she could barely eat anything more than a smoothie. So thin and weak she would fall and when she did there was no flesh so that her bones would hit the floor and she would cry out in pain. It made me think how much the woman described here suffered not just for 1 or 2 years but for 12 years. A sad story. And not just physically. It carried with it a ritual defilement so that she was excluded from the synagogue. There were physical effects, social effects and spiritual effects. She could not go to the synagogue, so she never could be taught the word of God.  She couldn't go and worship.  She couldn't join other women and go and learn.  Can you imagine the impact on your life if you stopped studying the bible? If you stopped worshipping? Or stopped meeting together? We tend to do these each week and even just missing once or twice we notice the impact on our spiritual health. Without bible study, worship, fellowship we tend to become cold, dry and distant, even critical. This woman suffered physically, socially and spiritually. 

Yet she heard of news about Jesus. She came to believe that Jesus would heal her if she could just touch the edge of his cloak. Overcoming all the barriers she pressed through the crowd until she touched him. What happened? Look at verse 44. She touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. It was merely a small act to touch Jesus� cloak yet its� result was amazing. There must have been people who tried to touch Jesus� body among the crowd but nothing happened to them. But she touched the cloak of Jesus and a wonderful work of God happened. Mark 5:28 says she thought �If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.� She believed in her heart and touched by faith. 

After being healed, she wanted to sneak out secretly. Yet Jesus sensed her act of faith Look at verse 45-46, �"Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you." But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me." I know that power has gone out of me. Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. 

This account tells us a lot about Jesus and the faith through which he works. Pausing here what do we see? First in this passage we see the remarkable availability of Jesus. Twice Luke mentions the crowds reminding us that Jesus is accessible. Throughout Jesus� ministry he was almost always with people. Jesus did not try and avoid the crowds. He did not seclude himself in an ivory tower or say to people �not now I�m busy�. Even though the crowds crushed him and pursued him; even when the crowds sometimes tried to kill him he was accessible to them. At times he went to be alone with the father but in the morning he was always back with people. This is the heart of God. He�s not just concerned about humanity in general but Jesus really cares about people. Some people think of Jesus as distant and far off. This is not our God. Jesus was available. Jesus is available to us now. As Jesus said at the end of Matthew�s account, �and surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."  (Mth 28:20). Jesus is available. 

Second the compassion of Jesus. It�s often said that the miracles reveal that Jesus is God. And they do. But it would be possible to do this in a lot of ways.  For example Jesus could have gone up into the air and spun around a few times, fly across the Sea of Galilee in the air and land. That would do it. Or perhaps he could say, �Mountain move!� and see it hop. That would be very convincing.  Yet why did Jesus do healings?  Why did he carry out resurrections?  Because Jesus wanted to demonstrate not only his power but that behind his power is his compassion.  Jesus is not only capable of creating a world that is free of disease and death, he not only has the power to do it, He has the desire to do it because of his compassion. Jesus wants to heals us. Jesus wants to restore us. Jesus has compassion.

Third notice the personal response of Jesus. Jesus gives a unique insight into his heart at verse 46: �I know that power has gone out from me�. Although Jesus was helping Jairus he was interrupted and responded to this woman. This is the power of God. We see the personal nature of God that the power of God flows from Him to this woman. Likewise with us he feels the flow. Jesus is not impersonal.  Jesus is not detached.  When Jesus touches a life power flows and he feels it. 

Why does all this matter? It means Jesus knows you. He knows your hurts, your needs.  It means he is accessible to us.  Jesus is available to us.  Jesus is willing to be interrupted by us.  He is inexhaustible in meeting our need.  And it's personal with Jesus.  He feels the flow of power into our lives.  This is our God. This is Jesus Christ.  

You may say this all sounds great � Jesus availability, Jesus compassion, Jesus power. But how? In Jairus and the women we see the key that Jesus responded to was faith. What kind of faith?

First, imperfect faith. Notice that Jairus pleaded that Jesus come to his house (41). Was it necessary for Jesus to come to his house in order to heal? No. The Centurion knew that if Jesus said �the word my servant will be healed� (Lk 7:7). The women believed �if I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.� (Mk 5:28)  Does she need to touch his cloak? No. In other words you don�t have to get everything correct and in order for Jesus to hear and answer. There can be a lot of muddle in our praying yet by the grace of Christ God hears our hearts desire and trust in him. My daughter Anna loves flowers. She picked a handful of plants and flowers. But in it she picked weeds and dead stalks as well. �What�s that for?� I asked. �For Mummy!� she said. I took them and removed the weeds and stalks and rubbish and gave the bunch back to her. She ran up to her mother and gave her the flowers. Likewise when we pray to our heavenly Father we do so in the name of Jesus Christ. We go to the Father through the Son, and Jesus removes all our guilt and sin and presents our prayers to God, as a sweet smelling offering, acceptable to God. If faith is small as a mustard seed Jesus sees this and responds to it. Jesus sees it and responds to it. Faith need not be perfect.

Second faith that overcomes. Though the woman had experienced failure many many times over 12 years she did not give up hope to be healed through Jesus. There were many obstacles to overcome in order for her to touch Jesus: Wounds from repeated failure; the condemnation of the law; the crowd and what people might think of her. But like Jairus she is beyond caring what people think of her. Likewise we must fight the unbelief, the resignation, the fear and sense of despair as well as humanistic challenges. There are always barriers to Jesus and if there are not then you can be sure that the devil will find some and put them in our way! I come to think about our mission life. Some of us are a little more than 12 years in, some a bit less. But perhaps 12 is a good average. And aren�t there barriers and obstacles in our struggle to live as and raise disciples. Aren�t we tempted to turn round, pause or simply ease off? Yet here we see that Jesus is pleased with faith that struggles. Jesus responds when we battle to overcome and reach Him! Faith overcomes. 

Third faith that confesses. Although Jesus was pleased with the woman�s faith and responded, Jesus wanted her faith to be whole. She wanted to be healed and go. Like this woman we can be tempted to come to Jesus and get what we want and then go. But Jesus helped the woman confess her faith. He kept asking, �Who touched me? Who touched me?� until she came and confessed all to Jesus and the crowd. When she did this Jesus proclaimed, �Daughter, your faith has healed you.� (48). By saying so, Jesus helped her to live not by faith in signs but by faith in Jesus. In a sense he purified and strengthened her faith. If we have been healed by Jesus we should confess and acknowledge Jesus work. Romans 10:9 says, �That if you confess with your mouth, �Jesus is Lord,� and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.� Jesus helped her not only to believe in her heart but also to confess her faith and gave her peace that came from the grace of forgiveness and gave her salvation. 

II. Don�t be afraid; just believe (49-56)

Look at verse 49, �While Jesus was still talking with the woman, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler and gave sad news. �Your daughter is dead. Don�t bother the teacher any more.�   It seems Jesus took quite a long time to make sure the woman was healed and all the while he had a jumpy synagogue ruler on his hands. Can you imagine Jairus� pain as he heard �your daughter is dead�. This news was like a knife to his heart. His world collapsed. He may have thought: �If only I had been there�. If only I could comfort my wife�. If only I could have got to Jesus sooner�.� But then perhaps things turn a little darker �If only that woman had not come�that stupid woman�� Bitterness, complaint and unbelief in Jesus filled his heart, driving him to death. 

Notice that the person who came implied that Jairus was being foolish and burdensome to Jesus �don�t bother the teacher any more�. Why would he say such a thing? We can speculate but at root, this man was playing the devil to Jairus. He expressed his total lack of faith in God and in Jesus. Jesus has come to build us up in our faith. The devil works through the power of sin and death to tear our faith down. No one is immune from the devil�s attacks. When life is going well it�s easy to have faith. We can think �God is pleased with me. God is blessing me� but when suffering comes bitterness and complaint come and we become susceptible to his deceptions. The friend was inviting Jairus to become such a jaded and cynical unbeliever, as he was.

How did Jesus help him? Look at verse 50. �Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, �Don�t be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.�  First don�t be afraid. Jesus told him not to be afraid. It is Satan who plants fear in our hearts. Satan makes people slaves of fear and throws us into despair. If fear comes in to our hearts, our thoughts become paralysed and our hands and feet frozen. At that time, however hard we try we cannot do much. Most of all, if fear continues it develops into unbelief and we walk away from Jesus. We stop bothering the teacher. Satan plants in the hearts of those who live by faith, fear of future, fear of failure, fear of health, fear of our children�s education, fear of billing. At that moment, we must look up at Jesus and hear his words: �Don�t be afraid.�  James 4:7 tells us Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Don�t be afraid!

Second just believe. Jesus quickly took out the poisonous arrow of fear from his heart with the words, �Don�t be afraid�. But it is not enough to say to someone �Don�t be afraid. Don�t worry. It�s OK. Don�t be anxious�. Rather Jesus healed him with a word of faith � �just believe, and she will be healed.� Here, �don�t be afraid; just believe� means to keep the first faith to the end. Although the situation had changed and his daughter died still Jesus wanted him to trust the power and love of Jesus and leave everything to Him. In other words, it means to believe Jesus himself is the Lord of life and resurrection. For this, he must not listen to those who planted unbelief and fear but look at Jesus and believe and obey his word. Jairus needed greater faith than the faith he had when he first came to Jesus and in a sense Jesus was challenging and helping him grow in faith. Likewise with us at times we have reasons to be afraid. Yet Jesus calls us to trust his word of promise. 

�Don�t be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed� This words teach how great the power of faith is. When Jairus believed, his dead daughter would live he would experience the power of resurrection. When he just believed, he would overcome the sorrow, despair, fatalism and paralysis of death. 

But in truth people think it is foolish to believe in this kind of desperate situation. We say �OK Paul, faith sounds nice but face reality - she is dead. Nobody will see people raised from the dead today. Are you saying if my child dies I should just believe and she will pop back to life? Yes I know that faith matters but there is nothing I can do. Don�t bother the teacher.�  Good points. Why don�t we see people raised from the dead today? For the same reason that we don't find it very often when Jesus was on earth. In the gospels you have the incident in the previous chapter of the raising of the son of the widow in Nain; and there is the raising of Lazarus in John 11, and then there is this incident. Jesus himself in his own ministry didn�t bring many people back to life. Why not? It wasn�t time yet. That is for resurrection day. That is, at the second coming of Jesus Christ. Why did Jesus raise and restore her? In order to show that Jesus has power over the realm of death. The raising of Jairus� daughter was just a sign of what is to come on the day of resurrection when Jesus comes again.

After planting faith in Jairus� heart, Jesus took Peter, James, John and the child�s father and mother to the house.  Jesus said, �My child, get up!� Notice that she was not Jairus� child. She was Jesus� child �My child, get up! He cared for this girl and loved this girl as a father. Jesus is the Lord of life. Jesus has power over life and is the life giver. Jesus still drives out fear from those who believe! Jesus drives back Satan and the power of death and enables us to live a courageous and victorious life that overcomes death. Why? Because we are his children and he loves us. 

So in summary sin results in suffering and death. We see that in both stories of the older woman and the young girl. Maybe some here identify with the older woman. You might say, �My life is many years of painful suffering.� If so today reach out to Jesus in faith, so that the power of God might be unleashed in your life. Some perhaps identify with the parents and you would say, �It is not me who has suffered, but I know and love someone who has, and it�s been very difficult to watch them suffer or perhaps even die.� Jairus� example is a good one, run to Jesus, cast yourself upon him, and invite him into your home, and into your life. But all of us one day will be in the place of this young girl. We will all die. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, therefore all die. If our faith is in Jesus, we will die in him, and we will rise like him, forever to be with him. And our Jesus is the one who bled like the woman. Our God came and bled and suffered like the woman, and our Jesus suffered and died like the girl, and he rose that in him, we might rise to be together forever with him. It is this Jesus that says to us �Don�t be afraid, just believe�.
