2011 Luke 16

THE CHRIST OF GOD

Luke 9:18-27
Key verse 9:20
�But what about you?� he asked. �Who do you say I am?� Peter answered, �The Christ of God�

Today�s passage happens about 3 years after Jesus first called his disciples. One day he asked them, �Who do you say I am?� Peter answered �The Christ of God�. Jesus was very pleased with his answer and taught how anyone should live as his disciples. May God help us also to newly confess Jesus as the Christ of God and let�s pray to open our spiritual eyes and accept the way of following Jesus.

This message is in three parts: Peter�s confession, the way of Christ, and the way of Jesus� disciples. 

1.	Peter�s confession (18-20)

Look at verse 18. �Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, �Who do the crowds say I am?� Luke mentions several times throughout his gospel key moments when Jesus prayed: before Satan�s temptation in the wilderness, later he prayed all night before designating his disciples, he also prays in the garden of Gethsemane. Jesus always prayed, but in particular Luke mentions the moments of great importance. Today was such a moment. Jesus wanted his disciples to confess him as the Christ, and he wanted to teach them the way of the cross. So, he prayed in private. Only the Holy Spirit can move a disciple�s heart to confess faith in him. He knew that for a man to confess him as Christ was not just a matter of teaching knowledge and truth, it is according to God�s sovereignty. Therefore God�s help was more important than simply teaching them the truth. We also need to pray before we teach people the word of God. 

After praying, he asked them, �Who do the crowds say I am?� Jesus wanted his disciples to think about and understand the people�s condition. To help people they needed to attend not only to their practical needs but to the issue of their salvation. The question who is Jesus, is the most important question a person can ask. The answer to this question determines the eternal destiny of our soul. No matter how good or moral a person is, no matter what good works one might do in church, if we do not know who Jesus is, our soul will not have any freedom or joy � we can have no light or life without knowing him. In that sense the heart of discipleship is knowing Jesus. Jesus declared. �Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent (John 17:3). When a person knows who Jesus is every other life problem can be sorted out. Knowing Jesus, is the starting point to our life of faith, the only foundation upon which God can work in a person�s heart. 

Look at verse 19. They replied, �Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.� Their reply reveals different qualities and character of Jesus as seen from a distance. People, who were moved by Jesus� manger life, holiness, spirit and message of repentance, and his willingness to speak the truth to power, thought Jesus was John the Baptist. Some called Jesus Elijah perhaps because of his powerful ministry, his ability to raise the dead and challenge spiritual corruption. Elijah was expected as the fore runner of the Christ, people where in expectation of the Christ but were stopping short of saying Jesus was the Christ. They also thought Jesus as one of the prophets of long ago come back to life. All considered, they were not sure who he was but they recognised a divine aspect to Jesus. How about people in our generation? We have different popular images of Jesus as a great man and teacher; some think of him more as a social revolutionist, a kind of proto-Che Guevara figure, who ultimately failed and ended up being crucified. Some view Jesus more historically as the founder of Christianity. Many students I speak to say they like Jesus but not the church. Though different, Most people regard Jesus as a great man. What all these ideas about Jesus have in common, is none of them have really looked at him seriously or deeply, but have entertained an image of Jesus at a distance. What did Jesus ask after hearing their reply?  
Look at verse 20a. �But what about you?� Jesus asked this time what his disciples thought. He wanted to hear their personal confession. So far numerous people came to Jesus all with different problems all with a hope that he would help them. Yet, most of them did not have the spiritual desire to really know him and learn from him. They wanted what they could get from him, they wanted him to sort their lives out, but they did not want to know him or commit to him and therefore, ultimately, they would not grow. Jesus wanted his disciples to know him more personally. He had called them and given them the privilege of sharing his life with them. He had allowed them to participate in great miracles and had shown them first hand his awesome authority and power over creation and the spiritual world. But now he wanted them to confess what they believed in their hearts. This is difficult it requires a personal commitment which is uncomfortable. Billy Graham spoke of a man who pushed a wheel barrow across a high wire over the Niagara Falls, he the asked the crowd if they thought he could actually push someone in the wheel barrow, they all said yes, but when he asked for volunteers there was silence. Though intellectually they assented to the idea, they would not give their personal commitment. When Jesus asked this question to the disciples, he wasn�t looking for cheer leaders or spectators, he wanted their confession.  
We can imagine there might have been a bit of an awkward silence. Then Peter answered, �The Christ of God.� This was the right answer, exactly the answer Jesus wanted to hear. This is what the angels had declared at Jesus� birth, �A Saviour has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord,� 
So what does Christ mean? Christ isn�t Jesus' last name. "Christ" is not a name, but a designation. "Christ" is a Greek word, the equivalent of "Messiah" in Hebrew, and means "Anointed One." In the Old Testament, special people were anointed by God with the Holy Spirit. Their anointing was the source of power and wisdom to deliver God's people from oppression. Jesus was specially anointed by God when baptized by John in the Jordan River. The Holy Spirit came upon Jesus and equipped him to deliver his people. By the power of that anointing, Jesus defeated the devil and began to preach the kingdom of God.

The coming of God's anointed Christ is well developed in the Old Testament. He is the promised seed of the woman who crushes Satan's head (Gen 3:15); he is Abraham's descendant through whom the whole world would be blessed (Gen 12:2-3; Gal 3:16); he is the king who sits on David's throne forever (2 Sam 7:12,16; Lk 1:31-33). In Isaiah he is called �Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.� He reigns forever with righteousness and justice. He makes everything right in the world once again. He is the deliverer of Israel, the hope of nations, and the Savior of all mankind. Peter boldly declared that Jesus was this Christ. In doing so, Peter declared loyalty and allegiance to Jesus. 
Before moving on to the next part, it is good to think a little more about the meaning of our personal confession, the one we have personally made to Jesus. This confession is like a bride confessing her love and devotion to her husband. When we make this confession to Jesus, spiritually he receives us as his bride and his people. He rules us with his power and love. He protects and abides with us until we see him in heaven. By confessing that Jesus is the Christ, we are saying that Jesus alone is our only Saviour, who delivers us from the sorrow and misery of life. He is also our Lord and King who we obey and who rules us with God�s peace. Many of us here are married, what is interesting is when we first made that commitment to our spouses, it marked the beginning of an intimate relationship that should continue to grow and deepen throughout our life time. When I married June, I didn�t know her so well, particularly the first months were up and down because I needed to mature, but it�s now been 10 years, I still I feel I am only just beginning to know her, and my love deepening all the time. In an even more profound way, our relationship and commitment to Jesus should also be deepening and maturing, that initial confession was a very important first step, which laid the proper foundation on which we could have a right relationship, but it was only the beginning.     
?. The way of Christ (21,22)

Look at verses 21 and 22. �Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. And he said, �The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.� Jesus strictly warned them not to tell anyone that he is Christ. And he started to teach the correct understanding of the Son of Man. The problem was that the view of the Messiah was so politically charged at this time. Israel had been waiting for the Messiah who could save them from Roman oppression. The disciples had also been waiting for the time of the Messiah�s coming. But, Jesus said that as the Christ he had to suffer a lot, die on the cross and rise again on the 3rd day. This was the complete opposite of political or popular glory. This was not the way of glory but the way of the cross. 

Jesus' way of becoming the Christ is a contrast to the way worldly rulers seize power. They sacrifice their followers to win victory and attain power and glory. But Jesus sacrificed himself. Jesus would suffer, be rejected and be killed. Why? It was the only way to save those who believe in him. Our real enemy is not our situation, or the system, or the people around us who always seem to make life difficult. Our real enemies are sin and death and the devil. In order to liberate us from these enemies, Jesus had to suffer and die. There was no other way. That is why he used the word "must." Jesus was the only one in God's universe who could accomplish the salvation of mankind. He alone is fully human and fully divine. His sacrifice alone is sufficient to solve man's sin problem and restore us to a right relationship with God. If he did not go the way of the cross, God's glory would be compromised and mankind would perish. But as we know, Jesus did go the way of the cross. Jesus suffered and died for our sins. Isaiah says, "...he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities...." Paul says, "God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement through faith in his blood" (Ro 3:25). Jesus' sacrifice purchased our forgiveness, gives us healing, and restores our relationship with God. 

    Then, on the third day, God raised Jesus to life. Jesus shows us that death is not the tragic end. After death, there is resurrection. According to Jesus, everyone who has ever lived will be raised again: the good to everlasting life and the wicked to condemnation (Jn 5:28-29). Our real problem is not just death, but the fact that after death we face judgment. Christ alone saves us from this judgment. He promises that those who die in him will also rise with him as heirs of his kingdom, where there are no tears, sorrow or pain. In a word, Jesus accomplished our complete salvation through his suffering, death and resurrection. Thank you, Jesus!

As disciples of Jesus we must know the meaning of his suffering, death and resurrection. On this basis, we accept him as king and give our lives to him. Before I knew Jesus as my Christ I thought my life was my own, I lived the way I wanted and was sinful and destructive in my life and the lives of others. Yet it was in understanding why Jesus went to the cross that I could really find out how serious my sin was and that I only deserved God�s judgment and condemnation, It was having the right understanding of Jesus that I could be saved and I could realize my life is not my own but his. In order to help others we need to pray for them to have a correct understanding of Jesus� rejection death and resurrection.   

?. The way of Jesus� disciples (23-27)

Confessing Jesus as the Christ and having the right understanding of the way of Christ, leads us to what it means to follow Jesus as his disciple. Look at verse 23. �Then he said to them all: �If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.� Jesus is here making a universal statement that applies to anyone who would come after him. Until now, Jesus' disciples had enjoyed a privileged status. They had been following Jesus without any conditions. But now, Jesus teaches them what it really means discipleship not just by name but by life. He is saying it�s no longer enough just to hang around Jesus and see what he is doing. Now the disciples must decide to meet the two requirements of discipleship. 

First, he must deny himself. Our culture tells us to "indulge yourself," and "treat yourself." But Jesus says deny yourself The goal of the self is self-glory, self-gratification, self-indulgence, and other "self-" words. The self claims that the universe exists to gratify the self. The self ignores God, and uses others for its own benefit. The self wants to exist, avoiding death at all costs. Once, we were governed by this wicked self. But since Christ has come into our hearts, we now serve Christ as our king. Instead of listening to the self, we must listen to Christ. Instead of serving the self, we must serve Christ. So we must deny the self every day. Whenever it whispers to us to "be selfish," we must say "no," and turn to Christ. The Bible teaches that the self cannot be self-helped. Rather the self must be crucified with Christ.

How can we deny ourselves? We must come to the cross each day, confessing our sins and asking Jesus' help. We must begin each day, not by figuring out what to do, but by yielding control of our lives to Christ. When Christ is our King, we come into harmony with his body, the church, and with what he is doing in the world. We can find out how to serve him practically. In order to do this, we must trust Christ to take care of us. We can claim his promise in Matthew 6:33, "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well." 

      Second, "...and take up his cross daily...." The cross symbolizes the painful difficulty required to accomplish God's purpose. Of course, accomplishing God's purpose gives us deep joy and the meaning of life. But it is not always easy or pleasant. We must bear painful hardships. Jesus wants us to take these willingly and positively, as he did. The cross here includes the pains of rejection from unbelievers, and the sacrifices that are necessary to share the gospel and raise disciples. The cross also includes the personal pains we may live with due to specific life problems or issues. God gives such crosses to his beloved children to help us know Jesus better. Paul said: "I want to know Christ...the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection of the dead" (Php 3:10-11). 

     Look at verses 24-25. "For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?" Our bodies and this world, and everything in it, will perish in the course of time. Human achievements will fade away, wealth will be consumed, relationships with others will end, and pleasures will be completely forgotten. Those who blindly pursue the treasures and pleasures of the world will perish. But those who accept Christ, deny themselves, and take up their crosses, gain everlasting life and eternal blessing in his kingdom. Investing our time and hearts and labor for Christ and his kingdom is the best investment of all. 

    Look at verse 26. "If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels." Jesus will come again in glory. He will have all power and authority, and his majesty will be displayed fully. He will appear as King of kings and Lord of lords. He will bless those who believed in him and curse those who opposed him. Then, those who were ashamed of him will feel greatly ashamed. But those who confessed him will share in his heavenly glory forever. This is not just a distant future hope. We can see the kingdom even now. Look at verse 27. "I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God." 

In the past, I always felt a little dread when studying this passage, confession, commitment, rejection, suffering, self-denial and cross. Tough words! And Jesus at this moment does change gear with his disciples. He doesn�t want them to remain self-serving babies capable only of drinking milk rather than solid food. But the more I study this passage I find the love and the grace of God. I find Jesus� heart in his desire to see his disciples grow, grow in their relationship with him, and grow in maturity, to really find their true selves as disciples, and find what is truly worth living for. Everything else perishes. The cross of Jesus is in that sense the greatest blessing, and when I really think about what is at stake, I don�t want to waste time indulging myself, afterwards I always feel empty and that I have squandered and wasted my life. I want to live fully for the glory of Jesus. These next two weeks are a little daunting for me preparing for the Easter conference, and traveling abroad. I can think negatively about the burden of crosses, but after this passage I don�t want to. These crosses are my blessing, opportunity and joy to know Jesus more deeply and grow as his disciple. Thank you Jesus!  

    Today we have learned the essence of discipleship from Jesus. At the heart of discipleship is a relationship with Christ. Jesus wants us to confess him as the Christ, receive his salvation, and follow him by denying ourselves and taking up our crosses daily. Let's prayerfully decide to do this today.
